The site serves primarily as a boat launch for the portion of the Dolores River flowing through the Dolores River Canyon Wilderness Study Area.

Beyond boating, other popular uses of the Gypsum area are rock climbing, OHV touring, and hiking. \n\n<p><br>There is no fee at this site, and camping is on a first come, first served basis. The busiest time of year is when there is a 'boatable release' on the lower Dolores from McPhee Reservoir, generally mid-April to mid-June. Outside of this timeframe, one would expect to have the area to themselves. For more information, please contact the Tres Rios Field Office.\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCabin campers can escape the city - and escape modern day amenities - by staying at the fully rustic, historic Crescent Mining Camp cabins. The cabins offer a true old fashioned taste of life on the mine in the 19th century, with no electricity or running water. Visitors can focus on the sounds of nature and the incredible views of the Rocky Mountains from its creekside location.\n  \nThe mining camp was built in the 1890s during the boom of mining and milling in Clear Creek Canyon. Miners sought mostly gold and silver, and attracted about 50,000 residents in the valley that is now rather remote. \n  \nThe cabins are adjacent to a road heavily used by off-highway vehicles (OHV) but have a private drive with a locking gate. Crescent Mining camp is a good location for OHV enthusiasts, but not visitors seeking quiet and solitude<h2>Recreation</h2>\nOff-road vehicle trails begin near the site of the cabins and hiking trailheads are within several miles. The most popular trails lead into the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness, which boasts nine mountain peaks over 14,000 feet.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThere are four cabins at Crescent, but only cabins Numbered 1 and 2 (one and two) are available for reservations. The two cabins are rented together; one cabin sleeps two, the other sleeps four. Visitors must bring furniture such as cots, portable tables and chairs; in addition, tent and RV camping is permitted for those who rent the site.\n   \nNo water, heat, electricity, or trash service is provided. Guests should bring plenty of water. Creek water may be boiled and treated for consumption. Other items to pack include cook stove, bedding, food, lanterns, matches, cooking utensils, dish soap, bring firewood or an axe to collect (dead/down trees only), and a first aid kit.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCrescent Mining Camp is located within the Leadville Ranger District, which is home to the Sawatch Range, the highest mountain range in Colorado. These rugged, glaciated mountains form the crest of the Continental Divide. Mount Elbert, at 14,443 feet, is Colorado's highest peak and 1 of 10 \"fourteeners\" located on the District.\n<br/><br/>\nAt an elevation of approximately 10,000 feet, Crescent Mining Camp sits at the base of Ervin Peak in Clear Creek Canyon. It is on the outskirts of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness in the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains. Clear Creek passes near the cabins and the Clear Creek Reservoir and the Arkansas River Valley are 9 miles east.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearest spot for pay phones and a grocery store is in Buena Vista, about an hour's drive.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors can head to Clear Creek Reservoir, about 9 miles east, for fishing and boating. Fish species include brook trout, brown trout and tiger muskie. A few miles further is the Arkansas River, in a section where whitewater rafting is popular.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Buena Vista, Colorado, head north about 17 miles on Highway 24. Turn left on County Road 390 heading west. Drive about 9 miles and turn south on the cabin access drive which is gated; the cabins will be visible immediately on the right. There are 4 cabins; the rentable cabins are the first two and will be clearly marked with 1 and 2.",

After the trailhead the trail splits, both directions and will complete the loop. Taking the left fork, the trail goes uphill and contains the majority of the difficult sections. At approximately 1.75 miles, the trail crosses a social/unofficial trail, stay to the left and continue for a mile past a second social trail crossing. The main trail will take a sharp right at this point and heads north. At approximately half a mile, the trail will come to another junction, take the left fork to continue the loop. At approximately 1.5 miles up the trail, it will begin to descend in a north/northwesterly direction for another 1.5 miles. At the next junction, the trail goes straight ahead into Roxborough State Park or to the right to continue to loop. (Roxborough State Park does not allow bicycles within its boundaries except on this section.) Taking the right fork, the trail continues uphill for about 1.5 miles and then begins to descend back to the trailhead. The trail will cross two more junctions, at the first function take the left fork, and at the second take a right.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "Animas Forks is located on a system of roads known as the Alpine Loop. The loop is a 65-mile (105 km) system of unpaved roads which connects the small mountain towns of Lake City, Ouray, and Silverton. Most of the land in the area is managed by either the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The Alpine Loop is visited by over 100,000 people each year. Animas .Forks, at an elevation of 11,200 feet (3,400 m), is more than two miles (3 km) above sea level.\n\nThe unimproved road from Silverton to Animas Forks is passable in summer by two-wheel drive vehicles. The road beyond Animas Forks over Engineer Pass to Lake City may require four-wheel drive. The town's first log cabin was built in 1873 and by 1876 the community had become a bustling mining community. At that time the town contained 30 cabins, a hotel, a general store, a saloon, and a post office. By 1883 450 people lived in Animas Forks and in 1882 a newspaper, the Animas Forks Pioneer, began publication and lasted until October 1886. Every fall the residents of Animas Forks migrated en masse to the warmer town of Silverton. In 1884 a 23-day blizzard inundated the town with 25 feet (7.6 m) of snow, the residents had to dig tunnels to get from building to building. Mining, speculation and processing mills helped Animas Forks grow.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified. Although mining made a brief 1904 rebound with the construction of the Gold Prince Mill the town's mining days were nearing an end. A rail line ran through the area and stimulated interest in mining in the community again but the railroad never reached its expectations. The Gold Prince Mill closed in 1910 and in 1917 most of the mill's major parts were removed for a new facility in Eureka. The mill's dismantling signaled the beginning of the end for Animas Forks. The town was a ghost town by the 1920s.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified.

Many scenic trails provide access to the area that borders the north and east sides of Rocky Mountain National Park.</p><p>Wildlife includes elk, moose, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, coyote, beaver and many smaller mammals. Several species of birds make the Comanche Peak their home, including chickadees, hummingbirds, grey jays, red-tailed hawks, ptarmigan and golden eagles. Lakes and streams are inhabited by cutthroat, brown, rainbow and brook trout. A few of the streams have the rare and endangered greenback cutthroat trout.</p><p>Comanche Peak Wilderness is becoming very popular with summer backpackers, hikers and anglers. It is also popular with hunters in the fall.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nGraham Creek Campground is situated above Vallecito Lake, in the scenic San Juan National Forest of southwestern Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its beautiful scenery and wide range of recreational activities, including boating, fishing and hiking.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVallecito Lake is a very popular fishing destination, where anglers cast for German brown trout, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, kokanee salmon and northern pike. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe lake offers great boating, water skiing and canoeing opportunities. Boat rentals and fishing licenses are available at various locations around the lake.<br/>\n<br/>\nA variety of hiking and horseback riding trails are found in the area. The North Canyon Trail begins across the road from the campground and leads through ponderosa pine and aspen forests on its way through the canyon. A shorter trail leads to a scenic overlook of the lake.<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Creek Trail begins a quarter-mile up Forest Road 852, just northeast of the campground. The trail provides access to a lightly used, scenic drainage where fly-fisherman cast for brook trout. Both trails are popular with horseback riders, however, horses are not allowed in the campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single-family campsites, a few of which have lake views. Sites are each equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Vault toilets and drinking water are provided. The south side of the campground is adjacent to private property.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nVallecito Lake, Spanish for \"little valley,\" sits at an elevation of 7,900 feet. Scattered ponderosa pine trees tower over the open campground, offering limited shade. Hillside sites are about 100 yards from the high-water line and offer nice lake views. <br/>\n<br/>\nA thick understory provides privacy between sites. Thickets of willow separate the camping area from the lakeshore. Several short trails lead to the lake from the campground. High peaks of the San Juans are visible to the northwest of the campground. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park is visible to the north. Pikes Peak, South Park and New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountain's can be seen to the south. There are three significant structures at “The Top,” two of which are historic: the ruins of the Crest House, the High Altitude Lab and the Meyer-Womble Observatory. The Crest House was first open to the public in 1942, serving as a restaurant and souvenir shop. In 1979, the Crest house burned in a propane fire. The oldest structure up there is The High Altitude Lab. A wooden double A-frame building that was constructed by the University of Denver in 1935 to support cosmic ray research. In 1979, the University of Denver added a telescope, which in 1997, was expanded into an observatory. Take advantage of interpretive signs onsite that tell the story of these structures in great detail.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Named after the \"unsinkable\" Molly Brown on the Titanic, Molly Brown Campground, on the eastern shore of Turquoise Lake, sits in a shaded lodgepole pine forest. The campground offers access to boating, fishing, and hiking. <br><br><br><br>The famous Molly Brown lived in the town of Leadville, just 5 miles east of the campground. She became wealthy from her husband's mining success and took on a life as a philanthropist, socialite and activist.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe 1.2-mile Turquoise Lake Nature Trail is a gentle loop trail through the forest and down to the shoreline of Turquoise Lake. This trail connects to the 6.4 mile Turquoise Lake Trail that parallels the shoreline from the dam to May Queen Campground. It is recommended that hikers pick up a trail guide prior to departure to learn about the flora and fauna along this trail. \n  \nOn the lake, sailing, boating and canoeing are always enjoyed. Anglers seek out mostly mackinaw and rainbow trout. \n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The two-loop campground offers single family sites. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Vault toilets, drinking water, and trash collection are provided. Firewood is for sale at the Host site.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCampsites are perched along the scenic waters of the lake. Nearby is the Mount Massive Wilderness area, a 30,540 acre stretch of forest land which encompasses Colorado's second highest peak, Mount Massive at 14,421 feet. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe town of Leadville, a historic gold and silver mining town, is a fun place to explore with the family.\n<br/><br/>\nDrive on the Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway to Independence Pass, one of the highest paved passes in Colorado. Continue over the pass to the town of Aspen, a well-known ski resort town. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Silver Dollar Campground is situated near the eastern shore of Turquoise Lake in the shade of a lodgepole pine and subalpine fir forest. This family-friendly campground is a popular summer destination for boating, hiking and fishing.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHikers enjoy the  1.2-mile Turquoise Lake Nature Trail. The gentle path meanders through the forest and down to the shoreline of Turquoise Lake, and connects with the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail that parallels the shoreline from the Sugar Loaf Dam to May Queen Campground. Hikers can pick up a trail guide at the trailhead located near the entrance to Molly Brown Campground to learn about the flora and fauna along the path.\n  \nOn the lake, boating, sailing, canoeing and fishing are favorite activities. Anglers fish for stocked cutthroat, rainbow, brown and lake trout. Matchless Boat Ramp is located nearby.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers single-family sites, each equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided. Firewood is available for purchase from the Host. Parking spurs are gravel or dirt.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCampsites are nestled in the forest within walking distance of the scenic lakeshore at 10,000 feet in elevation. The Mount Massive Wilderness Area is nearby. The 30,540-acre expanse encompasses Mount Massive, Colorado's second highest peak at 14,421 feet. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVenture to Independence Pass for a scenic drive with breathtaking views of the Rockies and surrounding alpine tundra habitat. At 12,095 feet, it is one of the highest paved mountain passes in the country and marks where the Top of the Rockies National Scenic and Historic Byway crosses the Continental Divide.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated about 10 miles from the town of Woodland Park, Colorado, Meadow Ridge Campground is pleasantly situated on a ridge above the Rampart Reservoir. Here, campers have access to prime fishing and mountain biking and hiking trails. \n  \nThe campground is in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, due north of the popular Pikes Peak. The peak has an altitude of 14,110 feet and was first climbed in 1820. Its claim to fame is that it is America's easternmost peak over 14,000 feet.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRainbow and mackinaw trout are plentiful in the renowned fishing reservoir and hikers enjoy the trails in the area. Rampart Reservoir Trail and Nichols Reservoir Trail are both worth exploring. Rampart Reservoir Trail extends for 14 miles and is open to mountain biking.    <h2>Facilities</h2>\nMost campsites are nicely shaded with a grassy understory, and have limited privacy from other sites. Drinking water, picnic tables, campfire rings and two accessible vault toilets are provided for campers. At sites 6,7,10,14,16 and 18, the picnic table and campfire ring are below the road, and steps must be used to reach them. Firewood can be purchased onsite.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nSitting in a ponderosa pine forest at 9,200 feet, the 19-site campground overlooks the Rampart Reservoir. The surrounding terrain includes a mix of grass meadows, spruce, Douglas fir and aspen.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nTake the kids on a tour of the U.S. Air Force Academy or explore the quaint town of Green Mountain Falls. While there, ask the locals about the place they nicknamed Kermit the Frog Mountain.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The Missouri Lakes trail is 4.4 miles long. It begins at Missouri Creek Road #704 and ends at Cross Creek Trail and Fancy Pass Trail #2006: The first mile of the trail passes diversion dams and water pipelines. Just past mile 1, the trail crosses the creek at the mouth of a miniature canyon, creating a breath taking view. The trail winds through stands of conifers and crosses the creek several more times before emerging into a large lush meadow. The trail climbs a short, steep distance to the basin that holds the Missouri Lakes. At about 2.7 miles you will see a side trail left that leads to the first of the lakes, a short climb of 100 feet gain in 0.3 miles. Savage Peak dominates the view to the south above this first lake. The main trail traverses the basin past several other lakes before reaching the last lake at about 3.5 miles. To get a bird’s eye view of the lakes, continue up switchbacks to the 11,986-foot Missouri Pass and back down the other side to join the Fancy Pass and Cross Creek trails at 4.4 miles.</p><p> </p><p>* There is a <a href=\"../../../../../../../../../../Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5186375.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">printable Recreation Quicksheet for this trail</a> which is complete with directions, a map, details, and other information about this trail.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThirty Mile Campground is nestled on the banks of the Rio Grande River, just a short mile from the Rio Grande Reservoir. The location is perfect for anyone who loves to spend time fishing, canoeing and swimming. In addition, there are two trailheads and regular interpretive programs located at the campground. \n<br/><br/>\nAcross from the Thirty Mile is the Weminuche Wilderness, the largest wilderness area in Colorado. It's a famously rugged region with three mountain peaks reaching over 14,000 feet. \n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers and hikers are common campers at Thirty Mile, and the San Juan Mountains provide great fun for backpackers and horse packers. <br/><br/>\nTwo trailheads, Squaw Creek and Weminuche Pass, lead eager hikers into the Weminuche Wilderness and link up to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nNo electric site hookups are available. Firewood is sold onsite. There is ample parking for day visitors but stock unloading and horse trailers are not permitted. Sites are designed for both tent and trailer camping. Drinking water is available. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is located in a meadow among mature spruce and aspen trees, just between the Rio Grande River and Squaw Creek. All sites are nicely shaded and some overlook the creek.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Rio Grande National Forest spans 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest's western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness.",

The somewhat remote, semi-rustic cabin provides an ideal resting spot among aspen trees and mountain scenery. \n<br/><br/>\nOne of three cabins in the area, Oak Cabin was built in the 1930s for use by Forest Service employees at the Cold Springs Work Center. One of the other cabins may be occupied by Forest Service personnel. The area is easily accessed by vehicles, but a 4WD may be required in October, depending on weather conditions.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe North Uncompahgre boasts an extensive ATV trail system known as the Divide Forks ATV complex. Over 50 miles of trails can be explored here. \n<br/><br/>\nMountain bikers make use of the popular Tabaguache Trail System, and in fall, hunters frequent the area. Hiking and horseback riding are also enjoyable activities. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe single-story cabin, which sleeps four guests, has a small grassy lawn shaded by aspen trees. Furnishings include two twin-size beds in a bedroom, one queen sofa sleeper in the living room and one bathroom with a shower and flush toilet.\n<br/><br/>\nThe kitchen has a propane stove and refrigerator, plus basic cooking and eating utensils like plates, knives, forks and pots. Cleaning supplies are provided.   \n<br/><br/>\nDrinking water is supplied but the cabin has no electricity. Guests should bring propane lanterns, matches, bedding, toilet paper, dish towels, warm clothing, paper towels, and tools for gathering and cutting firewood. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=41645&actid=101\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<br/><br/>\nNo RV’s, campers, or tents allowed.<br/><br/>\nPlease conserve water. Water can be limited at times.  Bring back-up drinking water.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOak Cabin sits in a field with scattered aspen and mountain shrub vegetation on the north end of the Uncompahre National Forest. At 9,000 feet, the area offers crisp mountain air, mild days and chilly nights.\n<br/><br/>\nBlack bears, mountain lions, marmots and deer are among the wild inhabitants. Please be aware of <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/learning/safety-ethics/?cid=fsbdev7_002715\" rel=\"nofollow\">bear safety.</a>\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearest grocery store is in Grand Junction, which is 44 miles from the cabin. \n<br/><br/>\nAnglers looking for lake fishing can head to Big Creek Reservoir, about 14 miles away.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Seedhouse Guard Station is located approximately 26 miles north of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. It was constructed in 1933 and offers a unique lodging opportunity for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in the Routt National Forest.<br><br>This historic cabin is available for rent in the fall and winter. Guests can drive directly to the cabin when the roads are clear; however, winter access is only available by snowmobiling, cross-country skiing or snowshoeing over three miles from the end of the plowed road. The cabin offers some amenities, but guests need to pack in several of their own supplies.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nTrailheads leading to hiking and horseback riding trails are an easy drive from the guard station. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail passes near the cabin\nthrough the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nAnglers can fish for trout in the Elk River.<br/><br/>\n\nIn winter, the area is blanketed by snow for wintertime play. Snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular activities. All motorized activity, \nincluding snowmobiling, is prohibited in wilderness areas.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The historic guard station is furnished with two sets of bunkbeds with mattresses and can accommodate up to five guests (3 twin beds, 1 full bed). Other amenities include a propane range, refrigerator, lights, heater, table and chairs, cooking utensils and cookware.    <br><br>A campfire ring and a picnic table are located outside.  An outhouse with vault toilet is nearby. Horses may be kept in the corral or in the pasture in the fall; however, fencing is not provided. Hay must be certified weed-free.   <br><br>Drinking water and electricity are not available. Guests must provide their own supply of water for cooking, cleaning and washing. In winter, there is a large pot provided for melting snow.   <br><br>Guests need to provide their own food, headlights or flashlights, sleeping bags, pillows, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe guard station is nestled beneath a canopy of fir and pine forest at an elevation of 8,000 feet along North Fork Elk Creek near the Middle Fork Elk River. Mount Zirkel Wilderness is nearby, one of the original areas protected under the 1964 Wilderness Act. The area boasts ecosystems ranging from sagebrush meadows in the lower areas to alpine tundra at high elevations.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife is abundant near the cabin, including elk, deer and coyote. Migratory birds, squirrels and an occasional black bear find habitat in the forest as well.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Across the road from Seedhouse Campground. Less than 3 miles from several trail heads, many with access to the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area. Close to the Elk River. Closest store and restaraunts are Clark Store and Glen Eden Resort and Hahn Peak Roadhouse.</p>\n",
          "FacilityDirections": "The guard station is located about 26 miles north of Steamboat Springs, CO. From Steamboat Springs, take Highway 40 west and turn right on County Road 129. Head north on 129 (toward Clark) about 18 miles. One mile after Clark, take the first right after crossing the Elk River, Routt County Road 64, which is also Forest Service Road 400. Stay on this for 8 miles and the guard station is behind a locked gate, tucked in some trees on the left, across from the Seedhouse Campground. The last 3 miles is a dirt road and is not maintained in the winter.<br/><br/> \n \nFall access to the guard station is over both paved and gravel/dirt roads. Road conditions are variable and 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended.<br/><br/> \n\nWinter access to the guard station is by ski or snowmobile only. Parking is available at the end of county maintenance. The distance from a plowed road to the guard station is approximately 3.5 miles. The main road to the facility is a groomed snowmobile trail, but guests may have to break trail into the guard station. ",

Tucked within a rural, agricultural setting, Guffey Gorge is an 80 acre parcel of land located twelve miles away from Guffey, Colorado's town center. A  mile hike along West Fourmile Creek takes visitors through impressive rock features, wildflower meadows, and, upon entering the gorge, a ponderosa pine forest. After a steep descent down a hill, visitors can enjoy the small swimming hole that is bordered by rock walls and is fed by a cascade. The recreation site is day-use only fee site ($6.00/day) and provides a parking area for vehicles, an informational kiosk, vault toilets, and trash service during the summer months. Visitors are encouraged to be mindful of other visitors experiences and to pack out all trash. Possession of alcohol is prohibited, no amplified music; pets are required to be on leash, and visitors must park in the designated parking area. There is no overnight camping or campfires allowed, and no  portable fire grills, and glass is prohibited for visitor safety. It is illegal to park on the county road.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview:</h2>For a unique and unforgettable family experience, tour Picket Wire Canyonlands. Located on the Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta, Colorado, these primitive canyons are home to the largest dinosaur tracksite in North America!  Guided auto tours are the easiest way to experience Picket Wire Canyonlands and learn about its rich, colorful past. During the tour, knowledgeable guides will show you difficult to find dinosaur tracks, and the interesting prehistoric, historic, and natural features of the canyons. This auto tour is the only motorized access into the canyons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDinosaur Tracks <br/>\n<br/>\nLocated on the banks of the Purgatoire River in southeast Colorado, this dinosaur tracksite is the largest documented assemblage of trackways in North America. Over 1,300 prints in 100 separate trackways extend across a quarter mile expanse of bedrock. Apatosaurus and Allosaurus are two types of dinosaurs that left prints in the mud over 150 million years ago. <br/> \n <br/>\nThis tracksite has given scientists interesting insights into the social behavior of dinosaurs. Tour guides will tell you what scientists have learned and show you difficult to find small tracks made by a carnivorous dinosaur or theropod. Without a guide you will miss the whole story of the tracksite!  <br/>  \n <br/>\nRock Art  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose huge dinosaurs weren't the only prehistoric visitors to the canyons. Rock art images, together with the remains of dwellings, stone tools, and pottery, shed light on the lives of prehistoric people. Rock Art is the term used to describe images pecked or painted on rock surfaces by prehistoric people. Rock art can be difficult to find but guides will take you to some of the best sites in the canyons. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpanish Expedition   <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to legend, a group of Spanish treasure seeking soldiers died in the canyons without benefit of clergy. Thus, in the sixteenth century the river was named El Rio de Las Animas Perdidas en Purgatorio (the River of Souls Lost in Purgatory). Later, French trappers shortened the name to the Purgatoire. Early Anglo travelers on the Santa Fe Trail could not pronounce Purgatoire and hence further corrupted the name into Picket Wire  <br/>\n<br/>\nEarly Settlers  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 19th century, Hispanic and European settlers homesteaded in Picket Wire Canyonlands. Guides will take you to an early Catholic Church and cemetery, which was built on land donated by Damacio Lopez. You will also visit Rourke Ranch, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and learn how pioneer Eugene Rourke's ranch grew from a 160-acre homestead in the late 1800s to an over 50,000-acre cattle empire still owned by the Rourke family into the 1970s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoin us! <br/> \n<br/>\nDon't miss this opportunity to spend a day exploring Picket Wire Canyonlands with a knowledgeable tour guide! All day tours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) are offered on Saturdays and some Sundays in May, June, September, and October. Sign up early because the tours fill up fast!  Tours are offered through the USDA Forest Service. Due to rough roads, visitors will need their own four-wheel drive high clearance vehicle. <u>Additional tour dates may be available to groups. Call the USDA Forest Service at 719-384-2181 if you are interested in arranging a special tour date.</u>\n\n<br/><br/>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nFather Dyer Campground is situated on the eastern shore of Turquoise Lake in the shade of a lodgepole pine and subalpine fir forest. The family-friendly campground is a popular summer destination for boating, hiking and fishing.\n<br/><br/>\nThe campground is named after Father John Lewis Dyer, one of the first Methodist ministers to tour Colorado's high country mining camps.  For 20 years, beginning in 1862, he travelled the circuit encompassing Alma, Fairplay and Leadville, regularly skiing over the 13,186-foot Mosquito Pass on long, wooden skis.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe 1.2-mile Turquoise Lake Nature Trail is a gentle loop trail through the forest and down to the shoreline of Turquoise Lake. This trail connects to the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail that parallels the shoreline from Sugar Loaf Dam to May Queen Campground. Trail guides are available at the trailhead located about a mile south, at the entrance to Molly Brown Campground.\n  \nOn the lake, boating, sailing, canoeing and fishing are favorite activities. Anglers fish for stocked cutthroat, rainbow, brown and lake trout. Matchless Boat Ramp is located about two miles south of the campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers single-family sites. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided. Firewood is available for purchase from the Host. Parking spurs are gravel or dirt.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCampsites are nestled in the forest near the scenic lakeshore. The Mount Massive Wilderness Area, a 30,540 acre stretch of primitive land encompassing Colorado's second highest peak at 14,421 feet, is nearby. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVenture to Independence Pass for a scenic drive with breathtaking views of the Rockies and surrounding alpine tundra habitat. At 12,095 feet, it is one of the highest paved mountain passes in the country and marks where the Top of the Rockies National Scenic and Historic Byway crosses the Continental Divide.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nMogote Campground is located along the Conejos River, making it a perfect location for fishing and hiking. The pleasant campground is well shaded by groves of ponderosa pine and a mixture of cottonwood, spruce, willow and aspen. \n<br/><br/>\nThe campground is also in close proximity to the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad, home of America's highest and longest, coal fired, steam operated narrow-gauge railroad.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Conejos River is a Gold Medal River, offering a high potential for trophy trout fishing. Rainbow and brown trout are the most common species in the river. Popular hikes include the 15-mile Elk Creek Trail and the 10.9-mile South Fork Conejos Trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nCampsites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings with grills. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash bins are provided. An accessible toilet is located in the upper loop.\n<br/><br/>\nNo electric hookups are available. Firewood can be purchased on site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 8,400 feet, and is separated into an upper and lower loop. The lower loop sits along the fast-flowing Conejos River and many sites face the water. The campground is perched in a wooded section along the river valley.\n<br/><br/>\nRio Grande National Forest stretches across 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The forest encompasses a myriad of ecosystems ranging from high elevation desert at 7,600 feet above sea level to rocky crags at over 14,300 feet in the majestic Sangre de Cristo Mountains.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad can be accessed from Antonito. The train makes a 640-mile journey through abandoned mining towns, creating great entertainment for young and old.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Antonito, Colorado, go west on Highway 17 about 15 miles to the campground access road. Turn right and travel 1/4 mile to the Upper Loop Road.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated just outside Aspen, Colorado, Silver Bell Campground is hemmed in by aspen groves and subalpine forests on the banks of Maroon Creek.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 8,460 feet, allowing guests to experience warm summer days and cool evenings with probable afternoon thunderstorms. Come prepared for changing weather conditions. Snow is possible even at the peak of summer.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFor hikers and backpackers, the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Deadly Bells Trailhead at Maroon Lake, the West Maroon Trail gains elevation through aspen groves and evergreens, traverses boulder fields, crosses streams, and leads hikers through high-elevation (10,000+ feet) mountain passes. Climbing through alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in mid-summer. Check specific regulations for camping in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area.<br/><br/>\n\nFor day hikers and horseback riders, nearby Maroon Creek Trail offers a less crowded alternative to viewing the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak and the entire Maroon valley. The gentle, flat terrain offers scenic stops that are great for picnicking.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Silver Bell Campground has 14 sites, including tent-only and walk-in sites. RVs and trailers are welcome at the standard sites. Sites are equipped with picnic tables, vault toilets, food storage lockers (bear boxes) and campfire rings. Drinking water and electrical hook-ups are not available.  <br><br><br>Silver Bell campsites 2-4 and 8-14 are not available for advanced reservation on Recreation.gov and are set aside as first-come, first-served for up to the five day stay limit.  Please visit the welcome station on Maroon Creek Road during staffed hours 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on the day of arrival to check availability.  The campground is usually full before noon during peak Summer/Fall season.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Maroon Bells Scenic Area is surrounded by the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This wilderness is one of the five original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline. <br/><br/>\n\nTowering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique in the Rockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that gives the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby resort town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and shopping, there is a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this mountain town.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nHaviland Lake Campground is situated on its beautiful namesake within the San Juan National Forest, 18 miles north of Durango. Visitors enjoy the area for its canoeing, fishing and hiking opportunities in a scenic, natural setting. The popular campground is beautiful any time of the year. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nHaviland Lake is an 80-acre, no-wake lake with excellent boating, canoeing and fishing opportunities. An accessible fishing dock is located on the lakeshore. Anglers cast for rainbow and brown trout. A Colorado Division of Wildlife fishing license is required to fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral trailheads are in the vicinity. The Forebay Lake Trail begins in the campground and leads to small Forebay Lake, just over a mile east of the campground. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe historic Rico-to-Rockwood Wagon Road passes through Haviland and Chris Park. Built in the late 1800s, the road was used for six years until the railway opened.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single- and double-family sites, many of which have electric hookups. Picnic tables and campfire rings are provided, as are accessible vault toilets and drinking water.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on the shore of Haviland Lake, among shady, towering ponderosa pines, at an elevation of 8,705 feet. Many sites have lake views and easy shoreline access. Campers are awarded spectacular views of the Hermosa Cliffs across the lake. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

A mixed conifer forest hems in the shoreline, and nearby peaks offer an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRenowned for its fly fishing, Fryingpan River flows below Ruedi Dam. Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the \"toilet bowl.\" The fish feed on mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.<br/><br/>\n\nThe stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.<br/><br/>\n\nFor hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This 8-mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area.<br/><br/>\n\nBoating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible. Interpretive programs are popular activities.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nMollie B Campground has 27 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs. There is a maximum length of 40 feet for RVs. A dump station is available.<br/><br/>\n\nThe sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings. Guests also have access to flush toilets and drinking water, but electrical hook-ups are not available.<br/><br/>\n\nA boat ramp is available for use at this campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n \n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby town of Aspen is a  popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there are a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunites in this resort mountain town.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

The trail ascends gradually and then more steeply following an old jeep road for 1 mile before merging with the old aqueduct road. Follow the old aqueduct road to the right for 1/2 of a mile. In a little over 1/4 of a mile, the trail crosses the Brooklyn Gulch Creek Diversion. Stay on the aqueduct road which makes an immediate S curve and then straightens. A few minutes farther the New York Creek Diversion can be seen. A few steps before this diversion, the New York Trail enters the woods on the left where a sign is posted. If you miss the trail turnoff and come to the end of the road, retrace your steps and the trail will be about 50 yards back on the right. Once in the woods the trail parallels New York Creek for 3/4 of a mile ascending through spruce forests before crossing New York Creek and emerging into a meadow. The trail then ascends more steeply through alternating evergreen forests and open meadows for another 1-1/2 miles to the upper meadows above treeline. Marking the trail for the last mile before the pass are cairns and wooden posts. This portion of the hike is very steep and extreme caution is required to avoid damaging the fragile alpine tundra.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCow Creek South Campground is located on the northeast shore of Green Mountain Reservoir in White River National Forest, offering an ideal setting for visitors seeking a multitude of recreational activities both on water and on land.  fast<h2>Recreation</h2>\nEncompassing a landscape of rivers, mountains, trails and forest roads, the White River National Forest is one of the top recreation forests in the nation.<br/><br/>\n\nLocated on the shores of Green Mountain reservoir, Cow Creek Campground is a popular spot for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing and windsurfing.<br/><br/>  \n\nAnglers will find populations of rainbow and brown trout, as well as kokanee salmon when casting their lines out into the water.<br/><br/>\n \nSpring Creek is a popular off-roading area located at the northern end of the Gore Mountain Range. A network of roads open to off-road vehicle use meanders through lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forests. Viewpoints of surrounding mountains open up along these roads.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nCow Creek South Campground has 44 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers and RVs. Vault toilets are provided.<br/><br/>\n All motorized watercraft must be inspected for Aquatic Nuisance Species and must launch from a monitored launch ramp. The Heeney Marina below the Town of Heeney on the west shore is open during daylight hours throughout the season. Other ramps are available as reservoir water levels allow.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million-acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting eight wilderness areas, four defined seasons and ten peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\n\nThe White River National Forest was established in 1891 as the White River Plateau Timber Reserve; the second such reserve to be named in the United States. In 1905, the newly formed Forest Service was given authority of the reserve.<br/><br/>\n \nLong before this designation, the area was home to the Ute Indians who followed herds of elk and bison on their seasonal migrations.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nTake some time to visit Rocky Mountain National Park to learn about the diverse landscape and history of the area through interpretive programs and exhibits. In the summer visitors may want to traverse Trail Ridge Road from one side of the park to the other, reaching alpine vistas boasting elevations of more than 12,000 feet.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

The sandstone boulders that line the hillsides are seemingly made for climbing: the rock is textured but skin-friendly, it's featured yet strong, and the landings are generally fantastic. Approaches are almost all 5 minutes or less. Workers have recently put in a bathroom, and worked on access trails and landing zones in both Straight Canyon and Cottonwood Canyon. Climbing Zones we have worked on include: Trent’s Mom, Big Joe, Eden Zone, Hillside/Hulk, and Riverside.</p><p>For an Overview of Joes Valley Bouldering visit <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105880382/joes-valley\" rel=\"nofollow\">mountainproject.com</a></p>",

The lower elevation slopes have beautiful Aspen groves and open sagebrush meadows.</p><p>You will not find many trails in this Wilderness and, as a result, have a better opportunity for solitude. Most of the trails have spectacular views of the Gore Range which dominates the skyline on the other side of the Blue River Valley.  One can connect the Ptarmigan Peak trail to the Ute Peak/Pass trail for an amazing one-way alpine ridgeline hike of 12 miles.</p><p>Protect this special place for the future by <em>always</em> using <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> techniques and following all special <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/whiteriver/specialplaces/?cid=stelprd3825863\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wilderness restrictions</a> including:</p><p><strong>Camping</strong> – Wilderness appropriate campsites are previously impacted sites, at least 100 feet from trails, lakes and streams. </p><p><strong>Fires</strong> – Campfires need to be at least 100 feet from streams and trails. Within ¼ mile of lakes are “stove only” zones and campfires are not allowed.  Please refrain from having campfires near or above tree-line, or in areas without dead and down firewood. </p><p><strong>Human Waste and Trash</strong> – Poop and litter is piling up in popular destinations.  Do your part, pack out all trash (DO NOT BURN) and consider packing out your poop to prevent sanitation issues.  </p><p><strong>Dogs </strong>– Pets are required to be on a leash to protect wildlife, other visitors experience and your privilege to have them with you.    </p><p>\"<em>If future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than contempt, we must leave them something more than the miracles of technology.

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The Buffalo Pass area has been an increasingly popular dispersed recreation hub, partly because of its proximity to Steamboat Springs. The area, however, was lacking in Forest Service trails for people to enjoy the area, and many user created trails were developed instead. In response, in 2016, the Hahns Peak/Bears Ears Ranger District conducted an analysis of the potential effects of taking three different alternative actions: no action; closing all user created trails in the area; or constructing new trails and improving the user created trails. The resulting document, the <em><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd553389.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buffalo Pass Trails Project Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</a></em>, provided the necessary information for the District Ranger to make a decision on a course of action. The <em><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd553412.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Decision Notice </a></em>approved the alternative for the district to construct new trails and improve the user created trails in the area, for a total of approximately 43 miles of trail, as that supported the Forest Service management policy of providing for recreational opportunities while protecting resources. The decision also included the provision to prohibit bicycles and all other wheeled vehicles from riding off of designated trails and roads in the Buffalo Pass area.</p><p>Implementation of the project is now underway, with completion anticipated at the end of the 2018 summer season. Current <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd553512.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">trail status </a>information is provided on this page and will be updated as more trails are completed.</p><p>The district is in the process of planning the next phase of trails in the Mad Creek, Rocky Peak, and Rabbit Ears areas. The tenative timeline is:</p><ul><li>Winter 2017-2018: Informal scoping on potential alternatives.</li><li>Summer 2018: Field review of alternatives, as needed.</li><li>Early fall 2018: Draft environmetnal analysis available to the public for comments.</li><li>Late fall 2018: Final environmental analysis available.</li></ul><p>If you are interested in being part of the process, please contact <a href=\"mailto:kfoster@fs.fed.us\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kent Foster</a> or the district office.</p>",

The trail travels along the gas well road for 1 mile, a sign indicates where the trail departs from the gas well road. It follows the Clear Fork of Muddy Creek for another 8 miles. The Clear Fork Trail #810 is a gradual easy climb starting in brush country with mostly cottonwood and spruce trees along the creek bottom. As the trail climbs to the north it gradually enters into aspen trees.

This section, which connects the West Trailhead with the Cottonwood Trailhead, is also open to horses. This trail has become popular because it offers many scenic vistas and a unique display of geologic history. It connects Island Lake with Eggleston Lake, however, this may be extended to a circular hike by returning to the original trailhead on the Crag Crest Lower Loop Trail #711.1A. The trail rises steeply to the crest from the East Trailhead, and more gradually from the West Trailhead. Some sections along the top portion of the crest are narrow with drop-offs on both sides. Due to the high elevation of this trail, travel is often hampered by snow drifts until early July.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd542991.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geo-Ref Trail Map</a>   <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geo-Reference Instructions </a>  <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3815565.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crag Crest Brochure</a></p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAlvarado Campground, located at an elevation of 9,000 ft., is a prime location for accessing easy to challenging hikes in the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness. The variety of trails lead to high elevation lakes, picturesque waterfalls, and a number of stunning scenic overlooks. Alvarado is designed for a range of campers, with facilities for tent, RV and equestrian campers. \n<br/><br/>\nPike-San Isabel National Forests include over a million acres of wilderness and over half of Colorado's mountain peaks that reach above 14,000 feet. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nNear the campground are several trailheads that provide visitors with a variety of recreational opportunities. All trails are open for horseback riding and hiking. The Rainbow Trail is a premier ATV and motorcycle trail. The non-motorized Comanche and Venable Trails lead into the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness where waterfalls and alpine lakes may be enjoyed.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nAlvarado is divided into three unique areas. The lower level accommodates tents and RVs, the upper level is designed for walk-in tent campers, and part of the middle section caters to equestrian campers. There are no corrals but there is space to put portable corrals for horses. \n<br/><br/>\nParking aprons are dirt and gravel. Tent pads and lantern posts are located in the lower campsites only.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nAlvarado is perched on the side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains among sweet smelling ponderosa pine, aspen, lodgepole and gambel oak trees. Some sites offer views of the Wet Mountain Valley below while others sit beside Alvarado Creek.\nThe campground is within reach of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness, which spans 226,455 acres with 60 alpine lakes, 400 miles of streams and over 400 miles of trails to explore.  \nLarge aspen stands visible in the area today are a result of fires set in the early 1900's to clear pasture land, expose minerals and produce charcoal. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nExplore the Frontier Pathways Scenic and Historic Byway that takes drivers through the Wet Mountains and provides spectacular views of 22 peaks, all within the San Isabel National Forest. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nFlorida Campground is located near the north end of Lemon Reservoir, in southwestern Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its fishing, trail opportunities and scenic natural setting.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Florida River is well known for its rainbow and brown trout fishing, but the river runs through much private land, so anglers should be careful not to trespass.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiking and biking are popular activities in the area. The Burnt Timber Trail No. 667 begins at Transfer Park, about a mile north of the campground. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe East Florida Road (Forest Road 597) winds steeply uphill past the campground. Lost Lake and Stump Lake Trails begin along this road, offering short, easy hikes to backcountry lakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe surrounding area is open to public hunting. Deer, elk and small game such as rabbits and grouse inhabit the forest.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers one group site, equipped with picnic and serving tables, as well as campfire rings with grills. Vault toilets and drinking water are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThis lightly used campground is situated in a shady forest of Colorado blue spruce, Douglas fir and aspen trees. The swift Florida River flows next to the campground.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLemon Reservoir is about three miles from the campground, offering boating, water skiing and fishing opportunities. The reservoir is stocked with rainbow trout and kokanee salmon. Many visitors take advantage of Colorado's Free Fishing Days, held annually the first full weekend of June.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung's Canyon Trail No. 546 begins at the north end of the reservoir. Hikers must cross the Florida River to access the trail; crossing is tricky during high water. The trail is very popular during hunting season.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

The trail goes through acres of broad valleys and scattered trees for the first 1.5 miles to Lyle Lake. About 300 feet above and 1/4 of a mile further than Lyle Lake is a tarn (a small lake) one might want to explore before going on to Mormon Lake. Once getting to Lyle Lake you have two choices on how to get to Mormon Lake; the path to the right is shorter, but involves crossing a small boulder field. Follow the trail over the crest and get ready for a gentle traverse. You will climb until wall at the valley's head to a grassy vale, pass a tarn on your left, veering left and you then will be able to see Mormon Lake 80 feet below.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nGreen Ridge Campground is located on beautiful Shadow Mountain Reservoir, southwest of Grand Lake in north central Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its great boating, fishing and hiking opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nShadow Mountain Lake is part of the Arapaho National Recreation Area. It offers boating, swimming and fishing. Anglers cast for kokanee salmon, as well as rainbow, brown, mackinaw and cutthroat trout. A boat ramp and dock are located within the campground. The Colorado River can also be accessed from the campground. National Fishing Week is held annually the first week of June. <br/>\n<br/>\nNumerous hiking and horseback riding trails are in the vicinity, including the East Shore Trail (which is part of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail), Roaring Fork Trail and Monarch Lake Trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers several single-family sites, as well as one double and one triple capacity campsite. Picnic tables, campfire rings and tent pads are provided, as are flush and vault toilets and drinking water. Firewood may be gathered in the forest or purchased from the host.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated between the southern shore of Shadow Mountain Lake and the banks of the Colorado River, at an elevation of approximately 8,300 feet. Afternoon thunderstorms should be expected during the summer months.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the mountain pine beetle infestation and consequent removal of hazardous trees, there is little to no shade available in the campground. Since 2008, 3,000 pine seedlings have been planted to remedy the problem in the future.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nRocky Mountain National Park's west entrance is located north of Grand Lake. With lush valleys and craggy peaks reaching elevations higher than 14,000 feet, visitors are provided opportunities for countless breathtaking experiences and adventures. Scenic driving, hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the park.",

The trail climbs in and out of numerous drainages for its entire length staying mostly in the lodgepole pine forest along with some aspen, spruce and fir forests. Most of the lodgepole pine trees are of the same age and provide ground cover and/or forage for wildlife in the area. You will cross some small clearings which were harvested in 1988. These trees were cut to increase the wildlife habitat and to improve the health of the forest by creating age and species diversity, thereby reducing the fire danger. Since the grade from Breckenridge toward Frisco is generally downhill, many people travel this direction and ride the free Summit Stage Bus back to Breckenridge.</p><p>* There is a printable <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5187088.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recreation Quicksheet</a> for this trail which is complete with directions, a map, details, and other information about this trail.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nDawson Cabin provides campers with a rustic, remote getaway in the beautiful Clear Creek Canyon. The Clear Creek Historical District offers visitors a taste of mining history from the mid-19th Century, when people came far and wide looking for gold, silver and other precious minerals. By the 1890s, about 50,000 residents lived in the valley, in search of great fortune. <br/><h2>Recreation</h2>\nOff-road vehicle trails and hiking trails are nearby. Some hiking trails lead into the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness, which is named for the numerous 14,000 ft. peaks named after colleges, such as Yale, Harvard and Princeton.  \n<br/><br/>\nCollegiate Peaks is the headwaters for the Arkansas, Gunnison, and Roaring Fork Rivers. The landscape is composed of alpine tundra, high lake basins and glacial river valleys. <br/><h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin comfortably fits up to four guests, but two additional guests may fit. Camping outside is permitted as well. Furnishings include a wood burning stove and an indoor picnic table. Guests should bring cots to sleep on, or at least bring a pad to sleep on the floor. \n<br/><br/>\nNo water or electricity is available. Guests should bring plenty of water. Creek water may be boiled and treated for consumption. Other items to pack include bedding, food, lanterns, matches, cooking utensils, dish soap and a first aid kit. (<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=12464&actid=101\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here for more cabin details.</a>) <br/><h2>Natural Features</h2>\nDawson Cabin is nestled at the base of Ervin Peak in Clear Creek Canyon, at an elevation of about 9,600 feet.  It is on the outskirts of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness in the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains. Clear Creek passes near the cabin.\n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin is located in the Leadville Ranger District, which is home to the Sawatch Range, the highest mountain range in Colorado. These rugged, glaciated mountains form the crest of the Continental Divide. Mount Elbert, at 14,443 feet, is Colorado's highest peak and one of ten \"fourteeners\" located in the District. <br/>\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe historic town of Winfield is about 5 miles farther up the valley.  The nearest place for pay phones and a grocery store is in Buena Vista, about a 45 minute drive. <br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors can head to Clear Creek Reservoir, about 5 miles east, for fishing and boating. Fish species include brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, and tiger muskie. A few miles further is the Arkansas River, where whitewater rafting is a big hit.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nArapaho Bay Campground is located on Lake Granby, southeast of Grand Lake, in north central Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its great boating, fishing and hiking opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Lake Granby is part of the Arapaho National Recreation Area. It offers boating, sailing, swimming and fishing. Anglers cast for kokanee salmon and a variety of trout, including rainbow, brown, mackinaw and cutthroat. National Fishing Week is held the first week of June each year. <br><br><br>Numerous hiking and horseback riding trails are located within the Arapaho National Recreation Area, including the Roaring Fork Trail, Monarch Lake Trail and the East Shore Trail (which is part of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail).</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers three loops of single- and double-family sites, a few of which are accessible. Each site is equipped with a picnic table, campfire ring and tent pad. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on Arapaho Bay, on the eastern tip of Lake Granby, at an elevation of 8,300 feet. Afternoon thunder showers should be expected during the summer months.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the mountain pine beetle infestation and consequent hazardous tree removal, the campground offers little to no shade.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nRocky Mountain National Park's west entrance is just north of Grand Lake. With lush valleys and craggy peaks reaching elevations over 14,000 feet, visitors are provided opportunities for countless breathtaking experiences and adventures. Scenic driving, hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the park.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From the intersection of U.S. Highways 40 and 34 in Granby, head north on Highway 34 for about 5 miles to County Road 6. Go east for 9 miles to the campground.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nNorth Fork Campground is set in a towering aspen grove on the western slope of the Colorado Rockies at an elevation of 7,800 feet. This is an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.  \n\nMost sites are widely spaced and open up to the river valley, though a heavy understory of tall grass and wild roses provide privacy. The North Fork of the White River is across from the campground.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFlowing near the campground is the North Fork of the White River, renowned for its fly fishing. Rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in this waterway. The nearby peaks and soothing sounds from the river offer anglers a perfect backdrop to an afternoon of fishing.<br/><br/>\n\nThe North Fork Campground is close to a number of OHV trails.  Use caution when riding, as domestic cattle may be grazing in the area.<br/><br/>\n\nHikers, hunters, mountain bikers and equestrians can also find recreational opportunities nearby.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nNorth Fork Campground has 39 standard sites able to accommodate tents, trailers and RVs.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, vault toilets, and drinking water. Electrical hook-ups are not available.<br/><br/>  \n\nFirewood is available on-site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.  \n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.  \n\nThe campground sits above the North Fork White River valley, surrounded by forested mountain peaks.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nWhitewater adventure seekers may want to raft portions of the White River, as it is navigable by small craft throughout most of its length to its confluence with the Green River.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (970) 927-0107.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nIn the heart of southwest Colorado is a group camp getaway for nature lovers and outdoor sports-enthusiasts. The Red Creek Group Site is located in the Curecanti Recreation Area, just south of the West Elk Mountains.<br/><br/>\nThe campground is surrounded by national forests and park lands with Gunnison National Forest to the north, Black Canyon to the west and the Uncompahgre National forest to the southwest. <br/><br/>\nA wide range of mammals can be found within Curecanti, including mule deer, mountain lions, black bears, prairie dogs, bighorn sheep, elk and the occasional moose. Bald eagles come here to fish in winter.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Hikers may enjoy the Dillon Pinnacles Trail for views of spires formed by erosional forces working volcanic debris. The trail is a lollipop of about 4 miles.<br><br>Anglers can enjoy fishing for brown, rainbow, and Mackinaw trout and Kokanee salmon. The population of Kokanee salmon is denser at Blue Mesa Reservoir than anywhere else in the country.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>This is a group camping site for a minimum of 9 people and a maximum of 20 people. Recreation vehicles over 22'' not reccomended.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>“This area is characterized by semi-arid shrubland with large cottonwood trees lining the campground. Red Creek flows out of the West Elk Mountains, through this campground, and into Blue Mesa Reservoir. By mid to late summer, the creek is low enough for wading. Some small fish inhabit the deeper pools.”<br><br><br>Blue Mesa connects to the Morrow Point Reservoir, which flows down to the more isolated Crystal Reservoir. The passage of the Gunnison River is marked by the steep, narrow cliffs of the Black Canyon.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The Cimarron Canyon Rail Exhibit features a display of an old-fashioned locomotive at the last remaining railroad trestle in the Black Canyon on the Gunnison route. The bonus is picture-perfect access to the tallest cliffs in the canyon.</p>\n<p>The Red Creek Road, which passes by the campground, provides access to national forest lands where hiking abounds.</p>\n",
          "FacilityDirections": "<p>Red Creek Group campground is located off of US Hwy 50 between Gunnison and Montrose, on the north side of the highway approximately 3 1/2 miles west of Elk Creek.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLa Vista Campground is situated in a meadow overlooking the west side of the 40-acre Lake Isabel. It is set along the Frontier Pathways and Historic Byway in the Wet Mountains along one of the Colorado Birding Trails.\n<br/><br/>\nLake Isabel is one of the few lakes in Colorado developed purely for recreation purposes. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the lake attracts many campers who come to hike, canoe, fish and spend time bird watching. St. Charles Creek flows near the campground and offers additional fishing opportunities.\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nLake Isabel welcomes non-motorized boating and fishing. Brown and brook trout are stocked in the lake and the St. Charles headwaters reap brook trout. \n<br/><br/>\nVisitors can enjoy hiking, bicycling or motorcycling on either the Snow Slide Trail and Cisneros Trail. The 15-mile Cisneros Trail, also open to ATV riders, leads to the heart of the Wet Mountains, through forests and open, wildflower speckled valleys. Along the way, the trail connects to St. Charles Trail, which heads to St. Charles Peak. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nWalk-in tent sites are 15 to 50 yards from the parking spurs. RV sites come with electric hookups and all sites include a picnic table, campfire ring and access to vault toilets and drinking water. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nShady pine and aspen trees are scattered throughout the campground. At 8,600 feet, the area enjoys cool summer days, a welcome relief from the heat in the plains far below.  \n<br/><br/>\nThe Pike and San Isabel National Forest includes over a million acres of wilderness and over half of Colorado's mountain peaks that reach above 14,000 feet.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nA nearby lodge provides paddle and rowboat rentals, groceries and a restaurant. Golf courses are about 15 minutes away.  <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPonderosa Group Campground, located near the sparkling 40-acre Lake Isabel, beckons large groups for picnicking and camping in the Lake Isabel Recreation Area. \n<br/><br/>\nThe campground accommodates 60 guests for overnight camping. Visitors can enjoy entertainment like volleyball and horseshoes, or head to the lake for canoeing and fishing. <br/><br/>\n\nLake Isabel is one of the few lakes in Colorado developed solely for recreational purposes. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the lake attracts many campers who come to hike, canoe, fish and spend time bird watching. St. Charles Creek flows near the campground and offers additional fishing opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nKayaking, canoeing and fishing are popular in Lake Isabel. Brown and brook trout are stocked in the lake and the St. Charles headwaters reap brook trout. \n<br/><br/>\nGuests can enjoy hiking, bicycling or motorcycling on either the Snow Slide Trail or Cisneros Trail. The 15-mile Cisneros Trail, also open to ATV riders, leads to the heart of the Wet Mountains, through forests and open, wildflower-speckled valleys. Along the way, the trail connects to St. Charles Trail, which heads to St. Charles Peak.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe group campground has a picnic shelter that seats 25 to 30 people, a group-sized charcoal grill and eight single-site campfire rings. A horseshoe pit, volleyball court, vault toilets, drinking water from a hand pump and dumpsters are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nShady pine and aspen trees are scattered throughout the campground. The shoreline of Lake Isabel meets the rocky base of sweeping mountains at an elevation of 8,600 feet.  At 8,600 feet the area enjoys cool summer days, a welcome relief from the heat in the plains far below.<br/><br/> \nThe Pike and San Isabel National Forest includes over a million acres of wilderness and over half of Colorado's mountain peaks that reach above 14,000 feet.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Frontier Pathways Scenic Byway is a great route to explore and snap photos. \n<br/><br/>\nA nearby lodge offers paddle and rowboat rentals, groceries and a restaurant. Golf courses are about 15 minutes away.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nThis location has limited staffing. Please call (719) 269-8500 for general information.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nEast Fork Campground is located 11 miles northeast of Pagosa Springs, just off U.S. Highway 160, along the East Fork Road. Visitors enjoy the area for its fishing, hiking and scenic opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe East Fork offers plenty of fishing opportunities upstream from the campground. Trailheads for the Coal Creek Trail and the Quartz Ridge Trail are at Sand Creek, 2-5 miles beyond the campground. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers several single-family sites, many with views of the river below. There are a few level pull-through parking spaces for RVs. Accessible vault toilets and drinking water are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits on a ridge overlooking the East Fork of the San Juan River. Some sites have views of the river, but it's a long way down the hill. Short, but steep trails lead down the hill, to the riverbanks. A forest of ponderosa pine and gambel oak trees shades the campground. At 7,700 feet, temperatures can be a bit warmer than at surrounding campgrounds. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSilver Falls is located a few miles up East Fork Road past the campground. A short trail leads to the base of the falls. Mountain bikers often ride to Silver Falls. Beyond its junction with Forest Road 684, the East Fork Road is negotiable only by 4WD. Off-road vehicle enthusiasts enjoy the upper section to Elwood Pass. <br/>\n<br/>\nTreasure Falls, located just off Highway 160 about five miles from the campground, is an impressive 100' waterfall with a short hike.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPlatoro Cabin 1 is located downtown in the small mining town of Platoro, Colorado, at an \n\nelevation of 10,000 feet in the Rio Grande National Forest.<br/><br/> \n\nThe cabin was built in 1963 by the Rio Grande National Forest as base quarters for various \n\nForest Service Crews working in the surrounding areas until the early 1990s.<br/><br/>\n\nToday the cabin is a getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south central \n\nColorado.<br/><br/>\n\nVisitors to the area should be aware that Platoro is only occupied when snow levels allow \n\ndriving access, which is usually less than six months of the year. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area around the cabin offers a variety of recreational opportunities year-round. \n\nSummertime brings great scenic driving tour opportunities in and around Platoro and \n\nSummitville.<br/><br/>\n\nAnglers have a spectacular backdrop while fishing Iron Creek or Treasure Creek. Nearby Platoro \n\nReservoir, which feeds the Conejos River, provides excellent fishing for kokanee salmon, \n\nrainbow and brown trout.<br/><br/>\n\nGreat hiking can be found around the area, as it spans both the Rio Grande and San Juan \n\nNational Forests as well as the South San Juan Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nBig game hunting is popular in fall, while snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular \n\nwinter activities.  \n <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin has a combination kitchen/living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. It is furnished \n\nwith two bunkbeds, with single beds on the top and foldout double beds on the bottom, accommodating up to six people. It has a heater, stove, refrigerator and lighting, all powered by \n\npropane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs and cooking gear. In the bathroom \n\nthere is a flush toilet and showers.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping \n\nbags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Guests \n\nare also encouraged to bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<br/><br/>\n\nNearby Platoro Cabin #2 is similar to Platoro Cabin #1, with the addition entry ramps and \n\nwheelchair accessible facilities in the bathroom and the kitchen.<br/><br/> \n\nThe town of Platoro has access to  rental cabins, a small lodge, outfitter-guide services and \n\nhorseback rides. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPlatoro is a natural and unspoiled destination nestled in the San Juan Mountains of southern \n\nColorado. Platoro started out as a boomtown in the late 1800s following the discovery of \n\nlarge deposits of gold and silver in the area.<br/><br/> \n\nThe nearby San Juan Wilderness is an area defined by peaks and cliffs as well as pinnacles \n\nand ridges. The headwaters for the Conejos, San Juan and Blanco Rivers are located here \n\nas well. The erosion of rich volcanic rock in combination with heavy snowfall has produced \n\nforest ecosystems in the area that transition from lodgepole pine to aspen, then through \n\nEngelmann spruce and subalpine fir to alpine tundra.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSummitville is a nearby ghost town where gold was first discovered in 1870, then mined until \n\nthe early 1990s. When contaminants leaked off-site and flowed into the local watershed the \n\ngovernment forced it to shut down. Now a water treatment plant is on the site as part of a \n\nfederal clean up program.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Antonito, CO, follow Highway 17 west to its junction with FSR 250.  Follow FSR 250 northwest up the Conejos Canyon about 22 miles to Platoro.  Turn left on FSR 250.6A and follow it 0.2 mile to the cabin.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\nFrom the town of South Fork, follow Highway 160 to the southwest for about 7.5 miles. \n\nTurn left onto Park Creek Road, which is also Forest Service Road 380. Continue for approximately 27 miles, paralleling Park Creek for much of the way. \n\nTurn right (south), crossing the Alamosa River, and follow National Forest Road 250 over \n\nStunner pass and into the town of Platoro. This stretch of the trip is about 6 miles long. The \n\ncabins are located on the southeast part of town. It is best to cross the Conejos River using \n\nthe lower bridge; this is National Forest Road 250.6A. Continue on this road for about .2 \n\nmiles to the cabins. The cabins are easily identified by their yellow and brown siding and \n\ntrim, as well as by the Forest Service signs.<br/><br/>\n\nNote: Be careful not to leave Forest Service Road 380 and continue towards Summitville. \n\nForest Service Road 380  makes a bit of a hairpin turn near the old mining settlement of \n\nSummitville. This occurs about 19 miles from the US Highway 160 and Park Creek Road \n\nintersection. ",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nGuanella Pass Campground is located about 7 miles south of Georgetown on the South Fork of Clear Creek on the Guanella Pass Scenic Byway.  Located at an elevation of 10,900 feet on the Arapaho Roosevelt National Forest, visitors to the campground can also enjoy hiking and fishing in the area.<br/><br/>\n \nThe Guanella Pass Scenic and Historic Byway follows an old wagon route that linked the mining towns of Georgetown and Grant, Colorado.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors can go trout fishing on the South Fork of Clear Creek. Silver Dollar Lake is nearby, but cannot be reached by car. Instead, the Silver Dollar Lake Trail leads hikers above treeline to the scenic lake.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground is split into two loops by the county road and South Clear Creek. There are 18 sites in the campground. Eleven are suitable for RV camping and seven are more suitable for tents.  Large RVs are not recommended on the byway.  Most of the sites are in the open with some tent sites located among some spruce trees. Each site has a tent pad, picnic table, fire ring and charcoal grill.   The roads through the campground are gravel.  This facility provides hand pumps with potable water, vault toilets and trash dumpsters.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland sit along the foothills and Rockies of Colorado. The forests and grassland cover 1.5 million acres and extend north to the Wyoming border, south to Mount Evans and west across the Continental Divide.<br/><br/>\n \nThe area includes mountains, lakes and five scenic byways, designated by Congress for their scenery, wildlife or history, including the highest road in North America. Mount Evans Road, also known as Colorado Highway 5, allows visitors to drive from 10,500' to 14,130' above sea level in just 14 miles.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy touring historic Georgetown, a former mining town of about 1,000 residents. Additional ghost towns dot the region.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From I-25 in Denver, take I-70 West to Georgetown Exit 228. Go south on County Road 381 (Guanella Pass Scenic Byway) for 9 miles.<br/><br/>\n \nFrom Denver take Highway 285 to Grant. Turn right (north) on to Park County Road 62. Drive approx. 14.5 miles to the campground.",

The trail then becomes more moderate following the stream through the woods before it crosses and emerges into a vast open valley. The valley is often marshy. As the valley narrows the trail climbs through alpine tundra. Cairns mark the way in those areas where the trail is hard to follow. The last section is steep climbing to the pass through tundra and then rocks. The trail here is unmarked with little or no cairns.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPeak One Campground is located on the Dillon Reservoir near the town of Frisco, offering an abundance of recreational activities. The reservoir is encircled by Swan \nMountain and the dramatic Gore and Tenmile Ranges. This campground is an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.<br/><br/>\n\nDue to the pine beetle infestation and removal of hazard trees, there is little or no shade in the campground.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nDillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground. At 3,233 acres, and with 26.8 miles of shoreline, it is an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing.<br/><br/>  \n\nAnglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.<br/><br/>\n \nOpportunities for hiking and biking in the area abound, including more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nPeak One Campground has 80 sites able to accommodate tents, trailers, and RVs.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, flush toilets, and drinking water. Electrical hook-ups are not available.<br/><br/>\n\nFirewood is for sale from hosts at the campground.<br/><br/>\n\nBoat ramp access is available in the marinas located in the nearby towns of Frisco and Dillon.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nDescribed as being more vertical than horizontal, nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness Area, designated in 1976, is a playground of craggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes, and deep, forested valleys. Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.<br/><br/> \n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nArapahoe Basin, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mountain ski resorts are all located within 10 miles of Dillon Reservoir. These resorts stay open year round.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",
          "FacilityDirections": "From I-70, take Frisco exit 203. Travel south on Highway 9 to Peninsula\nRecreation Area. Follow road approximately 2 miles to Peak One\nCampground. Please note that the new entrance to the campground is one-eighth\nmile south of the Frisco Peninsula Area.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>Collegiate Peaks Wilderness was designated by the United States Congress in 1980 and it now has a total of 167,584 acres. Located in Colorado this Wilderness spans the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/gmug\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunnison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/whiteriver\" rel=\"nofollow\">White River</a>, and Pike & San Isabel National Forests.</p><p>With eight \"fourteeners\" (peaks exceeding 14,000 feet in elevation), Collegiate Peaks Wilderness probably possesses the highest average elevation of any Wilderness in the Lower 48. The peaks include Huron Peak (14,005'), Missouri Mountain (14,067'), Mt. Columbia (14,073'), Mt. Oxford (14,153' ), Mt Yale (14,196'), Mt Belford (14,197'), La Plata (14,340 ft., the state's fifth highest point), and Mt Harvard (14,420', the state's third highest point). </p><p>Climbing these peaks is a very popular activity, making opportunities for solitude very elusive. Expect to be inundated by people and their dogs on any \"fourteener\" trail. As you travel through the area, you might notice unusual and deep indentations in the boundary line. These are a legacy of man's hunt for gold and other valuable metals that are still sought just outside. More than a dozen trailheads create a situation in which no one ever stands more than five miles from a road.</p><p>About 40 miles of the serpentine Continental Divide snake across the area, and this expansive Wilderness lies in parts of three national forests. The beauty of this place and its ease of access ensure torrents of visitors, especially on weekends. Timberline lakes and high mountain streams offer excellent fishing and scenery. Browns Pass, Red Mountain Creek, Texas Creek and Magdalena trails are in this Wilderness.</p><p>Please help keep Wilderness wild by following <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> practices. In particular, please refrain from having camp fires near treeline. The dwarfed Krummholtz trees that grow there are taking a beating from insensitive campers.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPrinter Boy Group Campground is located near Turquoise Lake, in an area with plenty of recreational opportunities, including boating, fishing and hiking.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHikers enjoy the 1.2-mile Turquoise Lake Nature Trail. The gentle path meanders through the forest and down to the shoreline of Turquoise Lake where it connects with the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail. Trail guides are available at the Turquoise Lake Trail trailhead, located at the entrance to Molly Brown Campground. \n<br/><br/>\nOn the lake, boating, sailing, canoeing and fishing are favorite activities. Anglers fish for stocked cutthroat, rainbow, brown and lake trout. A boat ramp is located nearby.\n<br/><br/>\nThe campground offers a playground, ball fields, horseshoe pits and a volleyball court. Campers must bring their own sports equipment.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nPrinter Boy offers four group sites: 1 and 4 can accommodate up to 75 people; 2 and 3 can accommodate up to 35 people. Sites 3 and 4 are accessible. \n<br/><br/>\nEach site is equipped with picnic tables, a campfire circle and grill.\nA centrally-located cooking shelter is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided. A dump station is located just outside the campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated within walking distance of the lakeshore in a forest of lodgepole pine and subalpine fir.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Mount Massive Wilderness area, a 30,540 acre stretch of primitive land is nearby. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby town of Leadville, a historic gold and silver mining town, is worth visiting for its small town charm.\n<br/><br/>\nVenture to Independence Pass for a scenic drive with breathtaking views of the Rockies and surrounding alpine tundra habitat. At 12,095 feet, it is one of the highest paved mountain passes in the country and marks where the Top of the Rockies National Scenic and Historic Byway crosses the Continental Divide.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation.

This wilderness is one of the five original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline. <br/><br/>\n\nTowering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique in the Rockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that gives the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nBig Meadows is located in the San Juan Mountains in south-central Colorado, about 11 miles west of South Fork. The campground is lightly wooded with spruce trees, creating a beautiful meadow atmosphere.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Rio Grande National Forest spans 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest's western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAn accessible fishing pier, located on the north shore of the reservoir, allows anglers to cast for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Hunting, boating and hiking are also popular pastimes. <br/><br/>\nHikers and horseback riders will enjoy the 6-mile Archuleta Trail. The trail accesses the Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado's largest wilderness, which boasts the headwaters of dozens of major streams and rivers that feed into the Rio Grande and San Juan rivers.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nEach site has a campfire ring and picnic tables. Drinking water is available.\n<br/><br/>\nThe nearest dump station is 13 miles away, and a boat ramp is located on the north shore of the reservoir.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground meanders up a mountainside above Big Meadows Reservoir in a series of loops. As a sub-alpine region, the campground gets more rainfall than the opposite side of the lake, resulting in plentiful wildflowers and aspens surrounding the campsites.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe surrounding area has plenty to keep visitors busy, with attractions like Great Sand Dunes National Park, Native American ruins, remnants of the Spanish Conquistadors and gold rush ghost towns. The Sangre de Cristo and San Juan Ranges are laced with trails for avid hikers.",

Located on the banks of St. Charles Creek, the campground is popular with campers who enjoy the sounds of water tumbling through the shaded boulders.\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nLake Isabel is stocked with brown and rainbow trout. The accessible lakeshore path provides ample fishing spots. Brook trout can be found in St. Charles Creek. Several trails begin at the recreation area. Hiking opportunities include the Snowslide Trail and the Cisneros Trail.

The trail then begins a very steep ascent for 200 yards before leveling out. Petroleum Lake is just ahead beyond the rise on the left. To the right of the lake the trail ascends for a short distance up to a high alpine pond. It then skirts to the right of the pond and rises gently to a saddle which provides exploration of the rocky knolls and breathtaking views of the Collegiate Wilderness. This short extension is well worth the effort.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated just outside Aspen, Colorado, Silver Queen Campground is hemmed in by aspen groves, a short walk from Maroon Creek, with views of 14,018 foot Pyramid Peak.<br/><br/> \n\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 8,460 feet, allowing guests to experience warm summer days and cool evenings with probable afternoon thunderstorms. Come prepared for changing weather conditions. Snow is possible even at the peak of summer.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFor hikers and backpackers, the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Deadly Bells Trailhead at Maroon Lake, the West Maroon Trail gains elevation through aspen groves and evergreens, traverses boulder fields, crosses streams, and leads hikers through high-elevation (10,000+ feet) mountain passes. Climbing through alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in mid-summer. Check specific regulations for camping in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area.<br/><br/> \n\n\nFor day hikers and horseback riders, nearby Maroon Creek Trail offers a less crowded alternative to viewing the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak and the entire Maroon valley. The gentle, flat terrain offers scenic stops that are great for picnicking.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Silver Queen Campground has five campsites available for advanced reservation which are able to accommodate tents, trailers, and RVs.  Sites are equipped with picnic tables, vault toilets, food storage lockers (bear boxes), campfire rings and drinking water.  Electrical hook-ups are not available.  Horses are not allowed in the campground.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Maroon Bells Scenic Area is surrounded by the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This wilderness is one of the five original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline. <br/><br/> \n\nTowering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique in the Rockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that gives the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby resort town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there is a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this mountain town.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nMay Queen Campground is located at the far western end of Turquoise Lake in a shaded lodgepole pine forest. Conveniently perched near the Charles Boustead Memorial Tunnel,  May Queen offers easy access to boating, fishing and hiking. <br/><br/>\nIncredible views of the Holy Cross and Mount Massive Wildernesses can be seen from the area, and visitors are likely to see native wildlife like chipmunks, beavers and porcupines. \n<br/><br/>\nThe Charles Boustead Memorial Tunnel is a 5.5-mile tunnel that transports water from the Fryingpan and Roaring Fork River Basins through the Continental Divide to the Arkansas River Basin by emptying water into Turquoise Lake. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nExplore the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail, which parallels the shoreline of Turquoise Lake from May Queen Campground to the dam. The trail offers moderate hiking with spectacular views and a variety of flora and fauna, as well as remnants of old mines. The Timberline Lake trailhead is 1/2 mile up the road. A 2-mile hike to this lake is rewarded with stunning views and high alpine lake fishing. The Colorado Trail can also be accessed from this trailhead.\n  \nOn Turquoise Lake, sailing, boating and canoeing are enjoyed. Anglers seek out mostly mackinaw and rainbow trout. <h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Campground offers single family sites. Each site is equipped with a campfire ring and picnic table. Vault toilets, drinking water, and trash collection are provided.  Easy access to the lake is provided for canoes and other hand-carried boats. Trailered boats can use Matchless Boat Ramp located on the east side of Turquoise Lake.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 9,900 ft. on Turquoise Lake. Most campsites are  situated on a level, open field along a creek, feeding into the lake. Six first come-first, serve-sites are perched on the wooded hillside above the creek. \n<br/><br/>\nNearby is the Mount Massive Wilderness area, a 30,540 acre expanse encompassing Mount Massive, Colorado's second highest peak at 14,421 feet. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields.  \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nNearby is the abandoned bed of the Colorado Midland Railroad, built in the 1890s. The trail is hard to trace, but visitors may find artifacts in the gulch it once crossed. \n<br/><br/>\nThe town of Leadville, a historic gold and silver mining town, is a fun place to explore with the family. \n<br/><br/>\nDrive on the Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway to Independence Pass, one of the highest paved passes in Colorado. Continue over the pass to the town of Aspen, a well-known ski resort town. \n<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The Vasquez Peak Wilderness was congressionally established in 1993. It encompasses 12,300 acres of tundra and spruce/fir forest in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Grand County, Colorado. Edward Berthoud named Vasquez Peak, the highest point in the Wilderness at 12,947 feet. Berthoud was the founder and engineer of the mountain pass through the Rocky Mountains into the Middle Park area of Colorado, now known as Berthoud Pass.</p><p>The Vasquez Peak Wilderness is bordered by the Winter Park Ski Area to the north; the Fraser Experimental Forest to the west; Berthoud Pass (Highway 40) road to the east; and Jones Pass and the Henderson Mine to the south. This high country Wilderness sits entirely above 10,000 feet with over half of its area above timberline.</p><p>There are over 15 miles of trail across the alpine tundra and only one trail that climbs through a spruce/fir forest. These trails lead up to two small lakes, across six peaks above 12,500 feet in elevation, and above numerous small creeks that start in high alpine basins. Along the southern boundary of Vasquez Peak Wilderness the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail offers opportunities for solitude and views.</p><p>With much of the trail system above timberline, sudden summer thunderstorms can make exposure to lightning in the Vasquez Mountains a dangerous risk. Plan on hiking early and dropping into the trees before afternoon storms break. In winter, avalanches are common.</p><p>Always use <a href=\"http://lnt.org/learn/7-principles%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>This page describes the western half of the Battlement Trail. This portion of the trail traverses the Battlement Mesa, and can be accessed from the west via the Battlement Road or from the east via the Beaver Creek Trail. The trail stays along the top of the mesa, giving it an easy grade with good, wide tread. Along the way, the scenery alternates between stands of coniferous trees and open meadows. The trail crosses beneath North and South Mamm Peaks at approximately 4.5 miles from the Beaver Creek Trail (or 3.5 miles from the Battlement Road). Visitors can also expect to encounter several easy creek crossings along this route.</p><p>The entire Battlement Trail is 17.5 miles long. From the top of the ridge above Beaver Creek, the trail descends into the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/whiteriver/recreation/horseriding-camping/recarea/?recid=41197&actid=104\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mamm Creek drainage </a>and continues another 9.5 miles to the southeast. This ridge offers excellent views of the Mamm Creek drainage, Hunter Mesa, and the Grand Hogback.</p><p>The Battlement Trail is open to hikers and horseback riders. This area is popular during big game hunting season. Please note that the trail is not regularly maintained between the Battlement Road and North Mamm Peak.</p><p><strong>Historical note:</strong> The Battlement Trail is also known as the \"Government Trail,\" the \"CCC Trail,\" or the \"Cayton Trail.\" In the early twentieth century, forest ranger James Cayton followed this approximate route while patrolling the Battlement National Forest. You can learn more about James Cayton by visiting the webpage for the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/whiteriver/recarea/?recid=41267\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cayton Ranger Station.</a></p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLone Rock Campground, located along the South Platte River, boasts spectacular views and top-notch fly fishing waters. Hikers thoroughly enjoy the nearby Gill Trail and kayakers are drawn to the rapids of the rushing river. Wildlife viewing is rewarding here and campers may spot moose, mule deer, owls, golden eagles and more. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers flock to the river, renowned for rainbow and brown trout fishing. Tubing is also a popular activity.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Gill Trail is an intermediate hike that weaves through Cheesman Canyon. The trailhead is near the campground and extends 7 miles southwest to the Cheesman Dam at Cheesman Lake. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nAmenities include two vault toilets and drinking water from a community hydrant. Parking aprons and roads are paved, and each campsite has a picnic table and campfire ring. No RV hookups are available. Services include trash collection and firewood is available for sale.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on a hillside rising up from the South Platte River at an elevation of 6,479 feet.  Many sites are open and feature a view of the river. Privacy is minimal but ponderosa pines provide some shade. Temperatures are generally mild.\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe drive along Highway 126 from Pine Junction affords magnificent views of the valleys below. Pikes Peak can be seen in the distance and other prominent rock formations present themselves throughout the scenic drive.\n<br/><br/>\nLimited groceries are available in the town of Decker. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

Typical colors are bay, gray, sorrel and black. A few horses are also other colors like roan and buckskin.  To ensure that future generations can enjoy these majestic animals, the herd’s size is kept between 135 and 235 animals following current best management practices.  \n\nIn addition to the wild horses, there are numerous opportunities to view other local wildlife including pronghorn, mule deer, elk, badger, snowshoe hare and various upland bird species.",

On the North end of the RMA is the Lorax trail, which is a popular non motorized route. In the southwest corner of the area is the Thompson Creek campground and trail, which winds along Thompson Creek to views of the rare geologic “fin” formations.  There are 4 shaded campsites along the creek with metal fire rings.  There are not picnic tables or restrooms.  Must pack out all human waste to eliminate contamination of creek.  There are not waste collections.  Access is not recommended during wet or snowy conditions.  For more information, please contact the Colorado River Valley Field Office.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSpruce Group Campground, located in the Lake Isabel Recreation Area, is a great place to bring groups for picnicking and camping on the scenic Lake Isabel. The campground accommodates 50 guests for day-use and 40 guests for overnight camping. Some RVs can fit in the paved parking area for added convenience.\n<br/><br/>\nLake Isabel is one of the few lakes in Colorado developed purely for recreation purposes. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the lake attracts campers who enjoy hiking, canoeing, fishing and watching for wildlife. St. Charles Creek flows near the campground and offers additional opportunities for fishing.\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nLake Isabel welcomes non-motorized boating and fishing. Brown and brook trout are stocked in the lake and the St. Charles headwaters reap brook trout. \n<br/><br/>\nVisitors can enjoy hiking, bicycling or motorcycling on either the Snow Slide Trail or Cisneros Trail. The 15-mile Cisneros Trail, also open to ATV riders, leads to the heart of the Wet Mountains, through forests and open, wildflower speckled valleys. Along the way, the trail connects to St. Charles Trail, which heads to St. Charles Peak.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nSpruce has a picnic shelter that seats 25 to 30 people, plus a horseshoe pit and volleyball court. Two 3-foot wide grills are onsite and individual sites have campfire rings.\n<br/><br/>\nDrinking water is provided via a hand pump and an accessible double vault toilet is in the campground. There are no defined tent pads.\n<br/><br/>\nThe road through the group site is paved, and a parking area fits a limited number of RVs. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe St. Charles Creek runs next to the campground, and dense spruce trees surround the site. The shoreline of Lake Isabel meets the rocky slopes of the Wet Mountains at an elevation of 8,600 feet. \n<br/><br/>\nThe Pike and San Isabel National Forest includes over a million acres of wilderness and over half of Colorado's mountain peaks that reach above 14,000 feet.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Frontier Pathways Scenic Byway is a great route to explore and shoot photos. \n<br/><br/>\nA nearby lodge offers paddle and rowboat rentals, groceries and a restaurant. Golf courses are about 15 minutes away.  <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n\n",

This is where you can obtain rafting permits for one day trips launching at Rainbow Park and taking out at Split Mountain. \n<p>\nThe last section of the Green River in Dinosaur National Monument  is the nine miles of Split Mountain Canyon beginning at the Rainbow Park boat ramp and flowing swiftly downstream, punctuated by notorious rapids, assorted riffles, and stunning views as the river cuts swiftly through the mountain before reaching the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp.\n</p><p>\nAs with the rest of the river corridors within Dinosaur National Monument, this is a proposed wilderness and consequently managed as such. This means you will not hear motors or see vehicles anywhere along your trip.\n</p><p>\nPrimitive camping facilities exist at the Rainbow Park launch site and are quite popular in the summer months. The <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/rainbowparkcampground.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rainbow Park Campground</a> has only four sites that hold eight people each. There is no running water available at these sites, but there is a vault toilet. The launch location has been kept fairly primitive to help the visitor transition to the wilderness environment of the canyon. Due to the remoteness of the area and long drive times, many groups camp at their launch site the night before their river launch.\n</p><p>\nAt the Split Mountain take-out, there are <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/camping/Split_Mountain_Group_Campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=110134&topTabIndex=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">reservable group campsites</a> (flush toilets seasonally, no showers) as well as vault toilets year-round and a seasonally operational groover dump site.

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>Bonanza boomed between 1880and 1888. Silver, copper, lead and zinc were found and 1,500 mining claims came into existence,. Soon 37 building flourished along plank walks lining both sides of Kerber and Copper Creeks. The walks blended into the residential section, which grew up the hills and into the forest.</p><p>As the price of silver fell Bonanza lost its importance. By 1890 there were only 100 residents but some of the mines stayed in operation. In 1937 a fire wiped out the town of Bonanza and not many structures were rebuilt.</p><p>The remains of the Cocomongo Mill are still visible from Forest Road 862. Ore from the Bonanza Mine and Cocomongo Mine was pulverized, mixed into paste and placed in steam heated containers, Mercury and other compounds were added to the mixture to separate the gold and silver. During the mining and milling, heavy metals would seep into the nearby stream. Recently efforts have been made to restore water quality within the Bonanza Drainage.</p><p>Otto Mears participated in the mining boom by constructing at least twelve wagon roads, one of which was the Otto Mears Toll Road. It runs between Shirley and Bonanza. A gate was placed at each end of the road and a fee of 10 cents was paid to travel the road. The road wound its way up through Bonanza, over the hill to Shirley, and on to Poncha pass. A narrow gauge railroad line in Shirley picked up ore.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>July 16, 2014<br/>West Fork Trail update, San Juan National Forest</p><p>The popular West Fork Trail on the Pagosa Ranger District of the San Juan National Forest, which leads to the Rainbow Hot Springs and into the Weminuche Wilderness beyond, is open to public use; however, the Forest Service urges the public to use extreme caution visiting the area because of significant impacts from the West Fork Fire of 2013 and an ongoing spruce bark beetle epidemic. The trail passes through dense forests of standing dead trees, killed or weakened by either the fire or bark beetle infestation. For example, over two weeks in June, a district trail crew cleared approximately 250 dead and downed trees lying across the first five miles of the trail between the trailhead and hot springs.</p><p>About half of the West Fork Trail between the trailhead and hot springs is impacted and may pose safety issues, and conditions currently make travel by pack animals dangerous in certain sections. One portion of the trail near the hot springs is washed out and not recommended for stock travel at this time. Wilderness crews plan to work on this section this month to try to improve conditions. In addition, burned-out stumps have left multiple large holes along one mile of the trail between the first two bridge crossings, also making stock travel treacherous and foot travel difficult. The bridges, however, are in good shape, although one bridge did sustain damage from a falling dead tree. Its hand rails have been rebuilt and the bridge inspected.</p><p>Visitors are also reminded that camping near the hot springs can be dangerous because the root systems of the multiple standing dead trees in the area may not be intact and are very susceptible to wind throw. Past the hot springs, Forest Service crews have cleared standing dead trees along switchbacks, but at the top of the pass, the trail is washed out and deemed impassable to stock travel. In addition, crews have not yet cleared downed trees across the trail past the switchbacks.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated approximately 14 miles east of Basalt, Colorado, in the White River National Forest, Little Maud Campground is situated on Ruedi Reservoir at an elevation of 7,800 feet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSites at this campground open up to views of the reservoir and starry nighttime skies. A mixed conifer forest hems in the shoreline and nearby peaks offer an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRenowned for its fly fishing, Fryingpan River flows below Ruedi Dam. Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the \"toilet bowl.\" The fish feed on Mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of two fish over 14 inches. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This eight mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible. Interpretive programs are popular activities.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nLittle Maud Campground has 21 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs. There is a maximum length of 35 feet for RVs. The sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings. Guests also have access to vault toilets and drinking water, but electrical hook-ups are not available.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting eight wilderness areas, four defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there are a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this resort mountain town.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

This high alpine area contains the headwaters of the McIntyre, Rawah, and Fall Creeks, as well as the Laramie River.</p><p>The Rawahs are host to mammals such as elk, moose, mule deer, black bear, bighorn sheep, marmot and beaver. There are many species of birds including the red-tailed hawk, white-tailed ptarmigan, golden eagle, raven, Steller's Jay and a variety of warblers. Lakes and streams are inhabited with lake, cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Graylings are also found in this area.</p><p>The Rawah Wilderness is becoming very popular with summer backpackers, hikers and anglers. It is also popular with hunters in the fall. To encounter the fewest people, plan your trip for mid-week and use less popular trails.</p><p>Always use <a href=\"http://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine. </p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nTeal Lake Group Campground is set along a small yet scenic lake in north central Colorado in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. Located in the Routt National Forest at an elevation of 9,000-ft., the lake is popular for trout fishing and lies close to a wilderness area with a variety of hiking and off-highway vehicle trails. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nTrout fishing and boating are popular activities in the clear, calm waters of Teal Lake. Only electric boats and non-motorized boats are permitted. Off-road vehicle enthusiasts have easy access to the Grizzly-Helena Trail nearby. \n<br/><br/>\nHiking is great in the nearby Mount Zirkel wilderness, though hikers must drive to the trailheads.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nTeal Lake provides 17 individual campsites and one group site for up to 30 people. Campsites are private and have ample space. The group site has four picnic tables and two campfire rings for groups to gather. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nTeal Lake is a 50-acre lake surrounded by a rocky shoreline and pine-fir forest. Some previously forested areas of the campground have been thinned due to pests and thus have more sun than others.\n<br/><br/>\nBlack bear, bobcat, coyote, elk, mule deer and moose are just some of the many animals that inhabit the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and Thunder Basin National Grassland.\n<br/><br/>\nThe area is generally snow-free from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but visitors should come prepared for anything, including freezing temperatures and snow during summer. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe closest town is Walden, Colorado. Many more outdoor opportunities exist in the nearly 3 million acres of surrounding national forests and grasslands, including hiking, biking, camping, horseback riding, OHV riding, fishing, hunting, sightseeing and winter sports.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Walden: Take Highway 14 west for approximately 11 miles to Hebron. Turn right on County Road 24 driving west. After approximately 10 miles the road becomes Forest Road 60 and passes the Grizzly Creek Guard Station. Turn right on Forest Road 615. Drive approximately 3 miles and turn right into the Teal Lake Campground.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nJunction Creek Campground is located close to Durango, Colo., near the beginning of the Colorado Trail. Visitors enjoy the area for its excellent hiking and biking opportunities in a scenic natural setting.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Colorado Trail, also known as the Junction Creek Trail, begins nearby and stretches almost 500 miles to Denver as it rises through subalpine forests and alpine meadows above the timberline. Mountain biking is very popular on the Colorado Trail and the Logchute Trail System, which is nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nJunction Creek offers fishing for rainbow and brook trout. Skilled anglers may have luck near the campground, but chances improve upstream. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single- and double-family campsites, many with electric hookups. A group campsite is available that can accommodate up to 50 people. An accessible large-group, day-use picnic shelter, with electricity, can accommodate up to 65 people. <br/>\n<br/>\nGroup sites are equipped with picnic tables, serving tables, campfire rings  and grills and have access to a volleyball court and horseshoe pits. Single and double sites have tables and campfire rings. Accessible vault toilets and drinking water are provided. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on a south-facing hillside, a quarter-mile above Junction Creek. A forest of ponderosa pine and gambel oak covers the campground, which sits at an elevation of 7,300 feet.\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nHaviland Lake is a 35-minute drive from the campground. The 80-acre, no-wake lake offers boating, canoeing and fishing opportunities. Accessible fishing docks are located on the lakeshore.\n<br/><br/>\nThe small town of Durango is just minutes away, offering whitewater rafting, a river trail, shops and restaurants. It is also home to the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

Firewood is sold on site.\n\nSites #1-5, 7 ,13,21,23 and 24 are first-come, first-served, \"Walk-up\" sites. All other sites are reservable.\nSite #6 is used by the host from mid-May through September. After that time it is available as a \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThis area attracts many campers for fishing, bird watching and canoeing on the calm, pleasant lake. Ponderosa pines provide a fresh vanilla scent in the mountain air and aspens please visitors with golden foliage displays in autumn. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe historic Denver and Rio Grande railroad grade traveled from Salida, southwest to the summit of Marshall Pass. The grade travels along County Road 200 above O'Haver Lake. This is a very popular mountain biking route with cyclists traveling from Monarch Pass to Marshall Pass on the Crest trail and then traveling down the railroad grade into Poncha Springs. Silver Creek, Starvation Creek, Poncha Creek and the Rainbow Trail are also nearby trails.\n\n\n\n\nShirley Site is located off of Highway 285 and County Road 200 just below Poncha Pass. Shirley got its name during the 1880's when it served as a busy construction camp for men building the Denver and Rio Grande rail line over Marshall Pass to the ore-rich mines in Gunnison. By summer of 1881, Shirley boasted 14 large business tents, most of which were saloons and dance halls. Little remains of the town of Shirley except the coal stained railbed that can be seen just north of the Shirley site parking area. Shirley Site is a popular staging area for OHV riders and mountain bikers during the summer months and snowmobilers during winter. \n<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

Located at 9,720 feet in elevation, visitors can locate this campground on the right side of the road as you travel south from the Trappers Lake Outlet area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nTrappers Lake is known as the <a href=\"http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPyhQoY6BdkOyoCAGixyPg!/?ss=110215&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=stelprdb5182895&navid=100000000000000&pnavid=null&position=Not%20Yet%20Determined.Html&ttype=detail&pname=White%20River%20National%20Forest-%20Special%20Places\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cradle of Wilderness. </a>\nAt approximately 302 surface acres, the lake contains a strain of native cutthroat trout and the Colorado  Parks and Wildlife  operates a spawn collection station at the Cabin Creek inlet during May and June. \n<br/>\nTrappers Lake lies completely within the Flat Tops Wilderness; motorized boats and wheeled carts for boat transport are prohibited.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nShepherds Rim Campground has one tent site, and 15 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers and RVs. The sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings. Guests also have access to vault toilets and drinking water, but electrical hook-ups are not available.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting eight wilderness areas, four defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation. <br/>\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (970) 927-0107.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n There is an RV dump station within the Trappers Lake complex. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

Tucked back on Forest Service Road 700 behind the campground, 97 designated dispersed campsites have been put in place. Access from I-80, Vedauwoo exit 329 or from Happy Jack Rd, Hwy 210.These sites welcome all types of RVs and tent campers. Designated group campsites are available for parties over eight people. Much like the campground, Vedauwoo designated dispersed sites offer easy access to the various trails and other recreation opportunities throughout the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mbr/recarea/?recid=81613\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pole Mountain area</a>. Dispersed camping is defined as camping sites that are outside of the campgrounds and do not have services such as toilets, electric, water or trash, however each site has a rock fire ring, and the three group sites have a metal ring/grate. All vehicles and campfires must by within 50 feet of the site marker at all times, 100 feet or group sites. No more than two vehicles per site, except for group sites. Length of stay is limited to 16 days at a given site. Please back out all trash and human and animal waste.</p><p>There are multiple trailheads located near the Vedauwoo designated campground and designated dispersed campsites. Among these various trails is the Turtle Rock Trailhead, a favorite for visitors. The trail is a short hike, that allows for all levels of hikers. It covers a nice loop that passes multiple rock formations and a few beaver ponds tucked back in the tress. Stop into the Laramie Ranger Station for free trail guides.</p><p>Vault toilets are located at the Nautilus Rock TH and on FR 700D. No water or other services available.</p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCarnero Guard Station is situated in a high open meadow surrounded by forest at an elevation of 9,840 feet. The high-elevation cabin is located in the north-central area of the San Luis Valley in the Rio Grande National Forest.\n<br/><br/> \nThe guard station was first proposed in 1907 by the Cochetopa National Forest, and was originally named the John Smith Ranger Station after a homesteader who built a cabin near the site, but never filed on the land. Construction on the cabin began in 1908 and the name was changed to the Carnero Guard Station in 1916.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe cabin is a good base camp for hunting, and fishing, which is available at several creeks within a short drive. The area also offers many opportunities for hiking and off-road vehicle adventures in summer, and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter.\n<br/><br/>\nThere is an off-road vehicle trail about 10 miles southwest of the cabin that travels to within 2 miles of the La Garita Wilderness.\n<br/><br/>\nElk, deer, and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin, and moose have been spotted in the Moon Pass area, about 5 miles west.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe two-room cabin is furnished with four bunk beds (the top bunk is a single bed, the bottom is a fold-out futon couch that sleeps two) and can accommodate up to 12 people. The cabin has a stove, refrigerator, heater and lighting, all powered with propane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, cooking utensils and some pots and pans. A picnic table, fire pit and an outdoor vault toilet are also on site. There is no electricity at the cabin, however water is available by an outside hand pump. Water is also available at the Saguache Ranger District Office during business hours from May through November.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nVolcanic rock outcroppings dot the forested hillsides and wide pastures near the cabin. The La Garita Wilderness is located approximately 20 miles west of the guard station and features about 35 miles of the Continental Divide well above the timberline. \n<br/><br/>\nThis area also provides habitats for large herds of elk and mule deer, and on the southern slopes, there is an ancient forest of towering spruce and fir. It is a landscape of rushing streams, broad and gentle alpine meadows, beaver ponds, long talus slopes and tremendous mountain beauty.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nGuests at Carnero Guard Station are a short drive from Penitente Canyon, which has become a great draw for rock climbing.",
          "FacilityDirections": "Carnero Guard Station may be reached by traveling south on Highway 285 approximately 15 miles south of Saguache to the La Garita turnoff (Road G). In La Garita proceed west on County Road 41G for approximately 17 miles. Look for the cabin on the right. \n<br/><br/>\nNOTE: Forest Road 41G leading to the cabin is unimproved but may be traveled by passenger car, weather permitting. The cabin may also be accessed from Highway 114 west of Saguache, also on Forest Road 41G. During winter months, the cabin may be accessible only by snowmobile, skis or snowshoes.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nHeaton Bay Campground is situated at an elevation of 9,000 feet and centrally located for recreation and relaxation in the White River National Forest.<br/><br/> \n\nThere is little or no shade in the campground due to pine beetle infestation and the removal of hazard trees, but the sites offer open views to Dillon Reservoir and \nseveral mountain ranges.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nDillon Reservoir is 3,233 acres with 26.8 miles of shoreline, offering an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing. The reservoir supports a healthy population of \nrainbow and brown trout, in addition to a few cutthroat finding their way into the lake from feeder streams.<br/><br/>\n \nOpportunities for hiking and biking in this area include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Old Dillon Reservoir Trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide.<br/><br/>  \n\nFor those wanting a bit more solitude, hiking in the Ptarmigan Wilderness area is a wonderful escape from the crowds.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nHeaton Bay Campground has 87 sites, able to accommodate tents, trailers and RVs. Walk-in only tent sites available of a first-come, first-served basis.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, vault toilets, and drinking water. Guests can fill their RV tanks. Electrical hook-ups are available for a fee at several of the sites.<br/><br/>\n\nFirewood is for sale from hosts at the campground.<br/><br/>\n\nBoat ramp access is available in the marinas located in the nearby towns of Frisco and Dillon.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nArapahoe Basin, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mountain ski resorts are all located within 10 miles from Dillon Reservoir. These resorts stay open year round.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

Erupting approximately 4200 years ago, it is the youngest volcano in Colorado.Crater caused by Dotsero eruption. the site is a point of interest for hikers. This Holocene volcano erupted in the year 2220 BCE, give or take 300 years. When Dotsero blew, it created small scoria cones that were constructed along a NNE-SSW line on either side of the maar. The eruption date is based upon radiocarbon dating of wood found underneath some of the scoria.\n\n It is one of the youngest eruptions in the continental U.S. and it produced an explosion crater, a lahar, and a 3-kilometer (1.9 mi) long lava flow.\n\n Interstate 70 cuts across the lava flow. The main industry at Dotsero for years consisted of making cinderblocks from the volcano",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated approximately 14 miles east of Basalt, Colorado, in the White River National Forest, Ruedi Marina Campground is situated on Ruedi Reservoir at an elevation of 7,800 feet. <br/><br/>\n\nSites at this campground open up to views of the reservoir and starry nighttime skies. A mixed conifer forest hems in the shoreline and nearby peaks offer an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRenowned for its fly fishing, Fryingpan River flows below Ruedi Dam. Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the \"toilet bowl.\" The fish feed on Mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake. <br/><br/>\n\nThe stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of two fish over 14 inches. <br/><br/>\n\nFor hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This eight mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area. <br/><br/>\n\nBoating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible. Interpretive programs are popular activities.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Ruedi Marina Campground has eight standard sites suitable for trailers, and RVs. The sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings. Guests also have access to vault toilets and drinking water, but electrical hook-ups and tent sites are not available.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting eight wilderness areas, four defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there are a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this resort mountain town.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nTarget Tree Campground is located 7 miles east of Mancos on the north side of Highway 160 at an elevation of 7,643 feet. It is the ideal camping spot for day trips to Mancos, Durango and Mesa Verde National Park.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name, \"Target Tree,\" refers to the Ute Indians' use of the area to harvest sap and bark from Ponderosa pines as food supplements. They also used the trees for target practice, leaving several scarred trees throughout the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors may enjoy taking a short, accessible interpretive trail to view a historic target tree. The campground is also known for its great birding opportunities, with a sign in the campground that lists species found in the area. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Narrow Gauge Trail begins within the campground and climbs 3.4 miles to an old railroad grade. The rails were placed just three feet apart to allow trains to navigate through the rugged mountains.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single-family sites, many of which meet accessibility standards and are equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nA group site can accommodate up to 50 people and 10 vehicles. It also offers two divided corrals for those camping with horses. The site contains two pull-through sites and four parallel sites for RVs. <br/>\n<br/>\nVault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits on a south-facing hillside overlooking Thompson Park. A Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak forest provides shade in many sites.

All of this wilderness is located in Colorado and is managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service.</p><p>The Mount Massive Wilderness is bordered by the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness to the west. Mount Massive (14,421 feet), Colorado's second highest peak, and other mountains of the Sawatch Range have two distinctive characteristics: great height, and a huge, sloping bulk that makes them relatively easy to climb. Nowhere along the Continental Divide does the ground rise higher than the Sawatch Range, the crest of this continent. Just south of the Wilderness stands Mount Elbert at 14,443 feet, Colorado's highest summit. The divide marks the western boundary of this area, with the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness immediately to the other side. Dry lodgepole pine forests, typical of the eastern slopes of the divide, cover much of the lower elevations and give way to spruce and fir higher up before all trees yield to alpine tundra.</p><p>The Leadville National Fish Hatchery, managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, comprises approximately 2,500 acres. The majority of the Fish Hatchery lies within the boundary of the Mount Massive Wilderness. The hatchery land inside the Wilderness boundary is co-managed by the US Forest Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Forest Service is the principal land manager, protecting the Wilderness resources. The US Fish and Wildlife Service manages the fishery and water resources to protect and perpetuate native fish species.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recarea/?recid=12992\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colorado Trail #1776</a> crosses 10 miles of the eastern region, and only about 10 more miles of trails exist in this Wilderness.</p><p>Please help keep Wilderness wild by following <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> practices. </p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPicturesque White Star Campground lies at the foot of Mt. Elbert, Colorado's highest peak, among fragrant ponderosa pines. The campground provides convenient access to Twin Lakes Reservoir for plenty of water recreation opportunities.  \nIt also works as a base camp for hikers and mountain bikers who love to explore nearby trails such the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and the Mount Elbert Trail. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Continental Divide Trail, which runs from Canada to Mexico, passes by the White Star Campground. The hiking trail is open to mountain bikes in the section from Halfmoon Road South to Twin Lakes.  About 300 miles of the trail is within Colorado's borders. \n<br/><br/>\nTwin Lakes are Colorado's largest natural glacial lakes, and  sailing and water skiing are among the popular activities there. Fishing includes lake, rainbow and Mackinaw trout.  <h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>White Star Campground is comprised of three loops. Sage Loop has limited shade, and Ridge and Valley Loops have a greater density of ponderosa pine and spruce trees. Vault toilets, drinking water, and trash collection are provided. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Firewood is for sale at the Host site. A boat ramp, parking, and angler fishing areas are located just down the road from the campground. </p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground, at an elevation of 9,200 feet, sits on the north side of the Twin Lakes Reservoir near the base of Mount Elbert. The Twin Lakes Reservoir spans 2,805 acres and Mount Elbert stands tall at 14,433 feet.   \nNearby is the Mount Massive Wilderness area, a stretch of 30,540 acres that encompass Mount Massive, Colorado's second highest peak at 14,421 feet. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nDrive on the Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway to Independence Pass, one of the highest paved passes in Colorado. Or continue over the pass for a day trip to the town of Aspen, a well-known ski resort town. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

Summertime brings great scenic driving tour opportunities in and around Platoro and Summitville.<br/><br/>\n\nAnglers have a spectacular backdrop when fishing Iron Creek or Treasure Creek. The nearby Platoro Reservoir, which feeds the Conejos River, provides excellent fishing for kokanee salmon, rainbow and brown trout.<br/><br/>\n\nGreat hiking can be found around the area, as it spans both the Rio Grande and San Juan National Forests, as well as the South San Juan Wilderness.<br/><br/> \n\nBig game hunting is popular in fall, while snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular winter activities.   <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe accessible cabin has a combination kitchen/living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. It is furnished with two bunkbeds, with twin beds on the top and pull-out full beds on the bottom, that can accommodate up to six people. It has a heater, stove, refrigerator and lighting, all powered by propane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs and cooking gear and the bathroom has a flush toilet and shower. The cabin has entry ramps and wheelchair accessible facilities in the bathroom and the kitchen.<br/><br/> \n\nAlthough the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Guests are also encouraged to bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<br/><br/> \n\nThe town of Platoro has many amenities including a grocery store, rental cabins, a small lodge, outfitter-guide services and horseback rides. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPlatoro is a natural and unspoiled destination nestled in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado. Platoro started out as a boomtown in the late 1800s following the discovery of large deposits of gold and silver in the area.<br/><br/> \n\nThe nearby San Juan Wilderness is an area defined by peaks and cliffs as well as pinnacles and ridges. The headwaters for the Conejos, San Juan and Blanco Rivers are located here as well. The erosion of rich volcanic rock in combination with heavy snowfall has produced forest ecosystems in the area that transition from lodgepole pine to aspen, then through Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir to alpine tundra.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSummitville, Colorado, is a nearby ghost town where gold was first discovered in 1870, then mined until the early 1990s. ",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Antonito, CO, follow Highway 17 west to its junction with FSR 250.  Follow FSR 250 northwest up the Conejos Canyon about 22 miles to Platoro. Turn left on FSR 250.6A and follow it .2 mile to the cabin.<br/><br/>\n\nFrom the town of South Fork follow Highway 160 southwest for about 7.5 miles. Turn left onto Park Creek Road which is also Forest Service Road 380. Continue for approximately 27 miles, paralleling Park Creek for much of the way. Turn right, crossing the Alamosa River, and follow National Forest Road 250 over Stunner pass and into the town of Platoro. This stretch of the trip is about 6 miles long. The cabins are located on the southeast part of town. It is best to cross the Conejos River using the lower bridge; this is National Forest Road 250.6A. Continue on this road for about .2 miles to the cabins. The cabins are easily identified by their yellow and brown siding and trim, as well as by the Forest Service signs.<br/><br/> \n\nNote: Be careful not to leave Forest Service Road 380 and continue towards Summitville. Forest Service Road 380  makes a bit of a hairpin turn near the old mining settlement of Summitville. This occurs about 19 miles from the US Highway 160 and Park Creek Road intersection. ",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSituated above the Ruedi Reservoir, Chapman Campground sits at the base of a wide valley adjacent to the Fryingpan River in White River National Forest.<br/><br/>\n\nSites are surrounded by lodgepole pine, and several are at the river's edge, offering an ideal setting for visitors seeking recreation and relaxation.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFlowing through this campground is Fryingpan River, renowned for its fly fishing. Downriver, below the campground and Ruedi \nDam, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the \"toilet bowl.\" Here, the \nfish feed on mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.<br/><br/>\n\nThe stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife \nCommission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish \nover 14 inches.\n<br/><br/>\n\nChapman Reservoir is also an option for anglers wanting to cast lines in at its shore. Motorized watercraft is prohibited on Chapman Reservoir.<br/><br/>\n\nA horseshoe pit and volleyball court encourage game playing. A nature trail can be accessed from the site.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nChapman Campground has 84 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs. A group site is also available.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, vault toilets, and drinking water. Electrical hook-ups are \nnot available.<br/><br/>\n\nTrash and recycling collection is provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations \n\nof cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many \n\nothers, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

In addition to being an active communication site, the area is a popular dispersed recreation use area with hiking, recreational shooting, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and camping.  The lookout is a unique structure constructed of native granite which is situated at over 11,000 feet elevation and was built in the 1940s by the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The cab measures 14 feet by 14 feet and is completely lined by windows on each side and surrounded by a catwalk, all of which sit on top of a one story stone base.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Fire Lookout is open for reservations. We are excited to open the lookout, but wanted to share the following updates with renters: </strong></p>\n<p>-There will not be staff cleaning in between visitors to the lookout, all renters must thoroughly disinfect and clean before they leave.</p>\n<p>-Pack out all trash and anything brought up during your stay, please do not leave food, supplies or other items behind.</p>\n<p>-We will offer disposable items for eating.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nDavenport Campground was one of the first Forest Service campgrounds, and is near the now-abandoned Squirrel Creek Campground, the very first Forest Service campground in the country.  In 2010, Davenport was rebuilt to evoke the original 1920s design. Adirondack shelters and a common cooking shelter with stone fireplaces were built and old-style log picnic tables add to the historic character of this campground.     \n<br/><br/>\nThe campground offers access to an array of hiking, mountain biking, motorcycle and off-road vehicle trails.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe 4.5-mile Squirrel Creek Trail is open to hiking, biking, horseback riding and motorcycle riding. This trail meets the original Squirrel Creek Campground site where a major flood, in 1947, washed out the never-reopened road and campground. Silver Circle, Second Mace, and South Creek Trails can be accessed nearby, too.\n<br/><br/>\nAnglers enjoy casting for brook trout in Squirrel Creek.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single-family sites for tent camping only. Most of these are reached by walking on short foot trails to the sites from common parking areas. Some sites are accessible, and three sites have log Adirondack shelters. Each site is equipped with a picnic table, campfire ring and grill.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Moraine Park Campground is open for the winter season. This campground is first come, first served.  </p>\n<p><strong>Are you planning to camp summer 2023? Moraine Park Campground will be closed for a major construction project beginning late May 2023 through early Summer 2024.</strong> </p>\n<p>Moraine Park Campground (8,160 feet/2400 m) is located in Colorado's awe-inspiring Rocky Mountain National Park, near the Beaver Meadows Entrance on Highway 36. It is situated on the north side of Moraine Park, offering beautiful views of the vast park and the surrounding mountains.<br><br><br>From lush valleys to craggy peaks reaching elevations over 14,000 feet (4250 m), visitors are provided opportunities for countless breathtaking experiences and adventures. Scenic driving, hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the park. </p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Rocky Mountain National Park has 355 miles (570 km) of hiking trails that range from flat lakeside strolls to steep mountain peak climbs. Visitors enjoy the park's various lake trails (Bear Lake, Cub Lake, Mills Lake), waterfall trails (Adams Falls, Alberta Falls, Ouzel Falls) and summit trails (Deer Mountain, Twin Sisters Peaks, Flattop Mountain).  <br><br><br>The park also offers some unforgettable scenic driving routes, including Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road. Trail Ridge Road reaches 12,183 feet (3700 m) above sea level and is America's highest continuous highway. It climbs above the park's evergreen forests to its windswept alpine tundra, where visitors enjoy sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. <br><br><br>Driving along the historic Old Fall River Road is like motoring through an earlier era. Constructed in 1920, this steep, one-way, uphill, gravel road punctuated by switchbacks quietly leads travelers from Horseshoe Park through the park's wilderness to Fall River Pass, 11,796 feet (3595 m) above sea level. <br><br><br>Several visitor centers are within the park, offering ranger-led activities, education and history about the park, and seasonal nighttime programs.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Moraine Park Campground contains single family tent-only sites, walk-to tent sites and RV sites without hookups. There is no group camping at Moraine Park Campground. If you are looking for a group site, please check <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232462\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glacier Basin Campground</a>. </p>\n<p>Each campsite is equipped with a picnic table, fire ring with grate, sharable food storage lockers, and tent pads of various sizes. Roads are paved and parking spurs are gravel. Flush toilets, dish-washing stations, and drinking water are provided at designated comfort stations. </p>\n<p><strong>Water.</strong> Loops B and E have vault toilets only, and water is limited in the winter to one location near the Ranger Station.   Two solar-shower stall facilities are located within Moraine Park Campground. Campers are encouraged to bring their own solar-shower bags as the campground does not provide them. There are no other types of shower facilities in the park, but hot showers are available in nearby communities. Portable showers are prohibited in individual campsites. </p>\n<p><strong>Summer (May to October)</strong>. The Ranger Station is open during the peak season and a dump and fill station are open for use to all campers. This service is located by the yellow bear sign and green dumpsters near the campground entrance. Additional dumpsters and recycling areas are scattered throughout the campground for the camper's convenience. The campground contains three main buildings at its entrance. Reservation information and check-in should be completed at the kiosk. Across the way, the Ranger Station provides information and services pertaining to all of Rocky Mountain National Park. Rangers are able to answer questions, provide Junior Ranger program booklets and badges, as well as give insight on planning your hike(s). Additionally, firewood is for sale at the firewood hut during the evenings; it is located next to the yellow bear sign, near the campground entrance.</p>\n<p>Ranger-led programs take place at the campground amphitheater in the C-loop. These programs are only offered in the evenings during the summer. For more information contact the Information Office at (970) 586-1206.</p>\n<p><br>Rocky Mountain National Park's free shuttle bus stops at the campground and provides access to the Cub Lake Trail, Fern Lake Trail, Bear Lake, Glacier Gorge, Sprague Lake and many other trailheads located along the Bear Lake corridor, eliminating the hassle of finding available parking. Campers are encouraged to use the free shuttle bus, as parking fills quickly. </p>\n<p><strong>Winter (October to May) . </strong>The Ranger Station is closed during the winter.  Water is limited in the winter to one location near the Ranger Station. The shuttle service does not operate in the winter nor are ranger programs offered.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>A pleasant mix of Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine and the occasional Engelmann spruce forests the campground, offering partial shade in this open area. Grasses, shrubs and seasonal wildflowers fill the open meadows. <br><br><br>Wildlife is plentiful in the park; mule deer and the majestic Rocky Mountain elk are the most commonly seen. Black bear, coyote, bighorn sheep and moose inhabit the region as well, but can be harder to stumble upon.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe town of Estes Park lies just outside the park's main east entrances, and is a short drive from Moraine Park Campground. Dining, shopping, rafting, fly fishing, horseback riding and golfing opportunities await. Lake Estes offers boating, sailboarding and fishing.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/rules-reservation-policies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rules and Reservation Policies</a> for information on changes and/or cancellations.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "The Phil's World Trail system is part of the Cortez Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA) with an emphasis on non-motorized trail opportunities. There are 15 miles of designated non-motorized trails on BLM (27 miles including adjacent State Lands under lease by Southwest Colorado Cycling Assn) and 13 miles of designated OHV trails on BLM. The Phil's World area is relatively flat, comprised of rolling mesa tops bisected by small but scenic canyons. The non-motorized trails are best described as 'flow trails' with low to moderate technicality. The trails are used intensively by mountain bikers, but open to other non-motorized users as well. Mountain bike use is limited to clockwise travel to reduce social congestion. The motorized trails are relatively flat and easy to navigate as well. For more information, please contact the Tres Rios Field Office.",
          "FacilityDirections": "The trailhead for Phil's World is located 3 miles East of Cortez, on the north side of Highway 160. It is located on State Land and accessed by Road 30.1 across from the Montezuma County Fairgrounds. Motorized trail users can start here, though they more commonly access the trails by continuing past the main trailhead, turning north on the first side road and either parking there, or continuing ѕ of a mile to an OHV open play area.\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nBlue Lake Campground is located in the beautiful San Isabel National Forest at an elevation of 10,500 ft.  Views of the nearby Culebra Range Mountains with aspen and spruce forests offer campers a genuine Colorado experience.    <h2>Recreation</h2>\nA well-marked trail system between Bear Lake and Blue Lake is open to foot and horse traffic.  Across the road from the campground FSR 436, a rough jeep road, provides access to Trinchera Peak where Big Horn Sheep are often seen. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis rustic campground has 16 campsites, each with a table and fire ring. Some are shaded; others provide full sunlight.  An on-site camp host offers firewood bundles for sale.  Vault toilets and drinking water are available. No electric or septic hook-ups are available.  Both reservation and first-come, first-served sites are available.  <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nA tributary of the Cuchara River runs through the campground. Blue Lake is 1/2 mile from the campground, and Bear Lake is one mile away.  Both of these small lakes are stocked several times during the summer providing for good fishing. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby mountain town of Cuchara offers shopping and visitor information. The town of La Veta offers a grocery store, gas stations, and shops.  The Spanish Peaks Wilderness, 14 miles from the campground, is a popular hiking destination.     <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n\n",

The best time to visit is late September through May when temperatures are comfortable. Visitors share the area with cattle grazing in the meadows and occasionally wildlife and cattle walk the trails. Trailer parking is available in the second parking lot with vehicle parking at the first parking lot. Visitors are encouraged to use the suggested camping sites, marked with a camping symbol. A wet weather gate closes the area to motorized use during wet conditions. This gate location allows some parking for non-motorized trail users. For more information, please contact the Royal Gorge Field Office. ",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Purgatoire Campground is nestled near the headwaters of the Purgatoire River in the beautiful Culebra Range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The primitive campground is laid out on two loops. One is a large grassy meadow with sites that accommodate equestrian campers and one that is wooded with aspen and spruce.<br><br><br>Constructed by the Youth Conservation Corp in 1976, Purgatoire was originally named Potato Patch Campground. The river provides nice fishing and a trailhead attracts hikers and horseback riders.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n The North Fork Trail # 1309 is located on the north end of the campground and offers non-motorized access to hikers, cyclists, and horseback riders. The 5-mile trail delights with mountain vistas and shade from forested terrain. The river, which is creek-sized at these upper reaches, provides opportunities for anglers to cast for trout. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nCampsites come with campfire rings, picnic tables and vault toilets. Equestrian sites can fit large horse trailers. Drinking water is from a hand pump and parking aprons are grass and gravel. Trash service is provided. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is in an aspen and conifer forest near the North Fork River at an elevation of 9,800 feet. The river, also known as the Purgatoire River, flows 196 miles to the confluence of the Arkansas River. \n<br/><br/>\nPike-San Isabel National Forest includes over a million acres of wilderness and over half of Colorado's mountain peaks that reach above 14,000 feet.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby towns of Stonewall and Cuchara offer shopping and restaurants.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nWillow Creek Group Campground is located on Lake Granby, six miles north of Granby, in north central Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its great canoeing, kayaking, fishing and hiking opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nWillow Creek Reservoir is a 300-acre, no-wake lake. It is open to canoes, kayaks and other non-motorized boats. Anglers fish for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Willow Creek can be accessed nearby. National Fishing Week is held annually the first week in June.<br/>\n<br/>\nNumerous hiking and horseback riding trails are located within the Arapaho National Recreation Area, including the East Shore Trail (which is part of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail), Roaring Fork Trail and Monarch Lake Trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers one tent-only campsite that accommodates up to 20 people. Single-family campsites are available at the campground on a first-come, first-served basis. Picnic tables, campfire rings, grills and tent pads are provided, as are vault toilets and drinking water.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on the southern shore of Willow Creek Reservoir, at an elevation of 8,130 feet. Afternoon thunderstorms should be expected during the summer months.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the mountain pine beetle infestation and consequent removal of hazardous trees, there is no shade within the campground.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLake Granby, Shadow Mountain Lake and Grand Lake are all nearby. Boating, sailing, fishing and hiking are popular activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe west entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park's is just north of Grand Lake. With lush valleys and craggy peaks reaching elevations higher than 14,000 feet, visitors are provided opportunities for countless breathtaking experiences and adventures. Scenic driving, hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the park.",

This area carries special legal designation to protect its natural, undeveloped and untrammeled qualities as well as providing outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.\n<p>\n<b>Permit Information</b><br/>\nPermits are required year-round for overnight camping in the vicinity of the Conundrum Hot Springs. The permit area includes all of Conundrum Creek Valley from Silver Dollar Pond to Triangle Pass. Overnight campers are required to reserve and camp in <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/Conundrum_Hot_Springs_Landing_Page.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">designated sites</a>. Each designated campsite has an individual maximum number of people allowed to camp at the site (from 2-6 people). <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/marketing/html/ConundrumHS_PermitZoneCampsites1Feb2018.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">View map </a>of designated campsites.\n</p><p>\n<b>Overnight permits are released according to the following schedule:</b><br/>\n<ul><li>\nOvernight permits for April 1-July 31 are available at 8 a.m. MT on February 15th\n</li><li>Overnight permits for August 1-November 30 are available at 8 a.m. MT on June 15th\n</li><li>Overnight permits for December 1-March 31 are available at 8 a.m. MT on October 15th\n</li></ul>\nOnce released, permits may be reserved online up to the day of the trip.   \n</p><p>\nThe maximum length of stay from June 1-September 1 is three nights.

The trail crosses Conundrum Creek three times before the hot springs.  Primitive log bridges span the first and the second crossings. The third crossing requires wading through the creek.  This crossing can be hazardous, especially during spring runoff, and is noteworthy for trip planning.  \n</p><p>\n<b>Driving Directions to Conundrum Trailhead from Aspen</b><br/>\nDrive a half mile west of Aspen on Highway 82 to the roundabout. Go around the roundabout and turn right onto Castle Creek Road. Drive approximately 5 miles up Castle Creek Road and turn right onto Conundrum Road. Continue 1.1 miles to a parking lot at the trailhead. Be careful not to stray onto the numerous private driveways found along the road. Trailhead parking is limited. Carpooling is highly recommended. Parking is prohibited on Conundrum Road. This narrow road is on a County right-of-way over private property. Vehicles are towed.\n</p>",

The first 1.6 miles of the trail follow an old mining road as you climb to Baxter Basin. The narrow single track trail will be on the left and marked with a sign. The trail becomes steeper as you near Daisy Pass, the steepest being just under the summit. At Daisy Pass, the trail enters the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recarea/?recid=80857\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raggeds Wilderness Area </a>where <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/specialplaces/?cid=stelprd3807547\" rel=\"nofollow\">wilderness regulations </a>apply. It switchbacks down from the ridge into Democrat Basin and in about 1.3 miles from the pass it intersects the Oh-Be-Joyful Pass Trail #835, stay to the left to continue on Daisy Pass Trail. In another mile the trail intersects the Oh-Be-Joyful Trail #836, stay straight to continue on Daisy Pass Trail. It skirts the base of the Ruby Range as it leads toward Blue Lake, in about ¾ of a mile the Blue Lake Trail 404.3A will be on your right. Continue straight on the Daisy Pass Trail which follows the curve of the basin and leads southwest of Garfield Peak, which will be immediately in front of you. The next quarter mile is a steep ascent, with incredible views of Democrat Basin, Purple Peak, Aftly Peak and Blue Lake. The trail then descends into Peeler Basin. Garfield and Peeler Peaks form the high points on the ridge to the north. Scarp Ridge, with several points above 12,000 feet, forms the south side of the basin. Traveling east, the trail loses its steepness and begins to follow a small stream. Approximately one half mile east of Peeler Lakes the trail forks again when it intersects the Daisy Pass Peeler Trail #404.5A. The Daisy Pass Trail stays to the right and crosses out of the wilderness area after about 1.4 miles. In about another mile the trail ends at FSR 585, Gunsight Road.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd589085.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geo-Ref Trail Map</a>   <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geo-Reference Instructions</a></p>",

A volleyball court, horseshoe pit and ball field are available. \n<br/><br/>\nThe Lee and Dorothy Rhoads Farm Implement Museum is located within the recreation area. The collection of tools, donated by the descendants of homesteaders, can help one imagine what life was like in pioneer days.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nCrow Valley Recreation Area contains four types of sites: a family campground, group overnight sites (Hawk, Plover and Lark), a group picnic area and an educational site (EDU). Vault toilets and drinking water are provided.\n<br/><br/>\nEach family site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. \n<br/><br/>\nThe group overnight sites can be reserved separately or together. Picnic tables and a campfire circle form a common area at each site. Tent pads are arranged around each common area. Parking is adjacent to each site. These sites have very little shade. \n<br/><br/>\nThe group picnic area can accommodate up to 200 people for day-use.

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The United States Congress designated the Dark Canyon Wilderness in 1984 . Great stone arches, old-growth ponderosa pine, aspen groves, meadows, hanging gardens and high country deserts are found at Dark Canyon.  The only designated Wilderness in southeastern Utah, the 47,116-acre Dark Canyon Wilderness is located in a beautiful and remote section of the Colorado Plateau.  Visitors are dwarfed by steep, sculpted and terraced sandstone walls that shade the canyon in morning and late afternoon -- hence the name.  Ancestral Puebloan structures and rock art are tucked among the cliffs.  (Please leave these treasures undisturbed for others to experience.)</p><p><strong>General Trip Planning Information:</strong></p><p>One of the biggest concerns with backpacking on the Colorado Plateau, including the Dark Canyon Wilderness is the lack of water.<br/><br/>Always treat water by filtering, boiling or chemical treatment before using any water in the backcountry.<br/><br/>Below are the general descriptions for water in the Wilderness and the lower canyon. Remember conditions change. This is wild country so always pack enough water to make it several days in case your next water source turns out to be dry.<br/><br/><strong>Woodenshoe Canyon:</strong><br/>Four miles down the trail you will run into Cherry Canyon coming in from the right (looking down canyon). In the spring there is usually water coming out of Cherry Canyon and running for a mile or more downstream. In the fall it stops running down canyon, but I have never seen the spring in Cherry Canyon dry up completley, although I have seen it running pretty low and muddy. The next water source is approximatley 7 miles downstream (although in the spring it is not unusual to find water in other locations as well) at an area known as Wates Pond. There is a large pothole and spring that usually holds water year round. Approximatley 1 mile below Wates Pond you will come to the Hanging Garden Spring, that flows out of the canyon wall on the right and usually has a pool beneath it.<br/><br/><strong>Dark Canyon:</strong><br/>If you are coming from the Notch Trailhead, you will usually run into water around the mouth of Drift Trail Canyon. There is also water coming out of the pipe near the Scorup Cabin at the mouth of Horse Pasture Canyon, although this water has a pretty bad taste. In the spring the water often flows from here to the junction with Dark Canyon and then all the way to Rig Canyon and beyond in good water years. In the fall most of this water dries up or gets fouled by livestock and the next possibility for water in Dark Canyon is approximatley 5.5 miles down stream near the junction with Trail Canyon. There are springs in the vicinity that usually run, however we have received reports in the fall of the Trail Canyon Springs being completely dry. Water has been found in Trail Canyon and Warren Canyon as well but don't count on it. Below there Dark Canyon is dry until about two miles down canyon of the Black Steer Canyon junction in the Dark Canyon Primtive Area (WSA) on BLM managed lands.<br/><br/><strong>Peavine Canyon:</strong><br/>Peavine Canyon often runs with water in the spring but drys up pretty quick in the summer. The only water in Peavine Canyon later in the year is usually located in a cattle trough about 3.5 miles below the Peavine Canyon Trailhead.<br/><br/><strong>Lower Canyon (Dark Canyon Primitive Area):</strong><br/>Usually about two miles below Black Steer Canyon the stream starts flowing year round.</p><p>We will try to update current conditions on this page or call the Monticello USFS office at 435-636-3340.</p><p> </p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Glacier Basin Campground (8,500 feet) is adjacent to Estes Park in the awe-inspiring Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. From lush valleys to craggy peaks with elevations reaching over 14,000 feet, visitors are provided opportunities for countless breathtaking experiences and adventures. Popular activities to enjoy in RMNP include scenic driving, hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding and wildlife viewing.  </p>\n<p>Some campsites at Glacier Basin Campground are available to be reserved up to 6 months in advance on a rolling window. Any sites that are open are listed as \"A\" for available. A number of campsites are available to be reserved 2 weeks prior to your desired camping date. These campsites are currently listed as \"NR\" for Not Yet Released. </p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Rocky Mountain National Park has 355 miles of hiking trails that range from flat lakeside strolls to steep mountain climbs. Visitors enjoy the park's various lake trails (Bear Lake, Cub Lake, Mills Lake), waterfall trails (Adams Falls, Alberta Falls, Ouzel Falls) and summit trails (Deer Mountain, Twin Sisters Peaks, Flattop Mountain). <br><br><br>The park offers some unforgettable scenic driving routes, including Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road. Trail Ridge Road reaches 12,183 feet (3715 m) above sea level and is America's highest continuous highway. It climbs above the park's evergreen forests to its windswept alpine tundra, where visitors enjoy sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys. <br><br><br>Driving along the historic Old Fall River Road is like motoring through an earlier era. Constructed in 1920, this steep, one-way, uphill, gravel road punctuated by switchbacks, quietly leads travelers from Horseshoe Park through the park's wilderness to Fall River Pass, 11,796 feet (3595 m) above sea level. <br><br><br>Several visitor centers are within the park, offering ranger-led activities, education and history about the park, and seasonal nighttime programs.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Glacier Basin Campground contains several group and family tent-only sites, as well as RV sites without hookups. Each campsite is equipped with a picnic table, fire ring with grate and tent pad of various sizes. Roads and parking spurs are paved. Flush toilets and drinking water are provided. <br><br><br>Rocky Mountain National Park's free shuttle bus stops in the campground, which is also across the street from Park & Ride, the park's main shuttle system hub. The shuttle system provides access to many park trailheads throughout the Bear Lake corridor and to the town of Estes Park.<br><br><br>Due to a pine beetle epidemic, all the trees in the C Loop, D Loop and the Group Loop have been removed, leaving little to no shade in these areas. However, the tree removal has opened up beautiful views of the mountains.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>A pleasant mix of Douglas fir, Lodgepole pine, Ponderosa pine and the occasional Engelmann spruce forests the campground, offering equal amounts of sun and shade.

The area around the guard station offers a chance to view abundant wildlife and experience a variety of recreational opportunities year-round.<br/><br/> \n\nThe guard station is accessible by passenger vehicle when there is no snow; however, high clearance vehicles are recommended in the spring and fall.\nAccess to the cabin in winter is only available by snowmobile, cross-country skis or snowshoes. The cabin offers some creature comforts, but guests should be prepared \nto bring some of their own supplies and gear.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn summer, hiking and fishing can be found within the vicinity. Trailheads leading to hiking and horseback riding trails are an easy drive from the guard station. Designated areas for off-road vehicles are also near the cabin.<br/><br/> \n\nIn winter, the area is blanketed by snow for wintertime play. Cross-country skiers and snowmobile traffic often pass by the guard station during daylight hours.   <h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The historic two-room cabin sleeps five on bunkbeds with mattresses. The cabin has a heater and range powered by propane. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, cooking utensils, pots and pans. An accessible outhouse with pit toilet is also on-site.<br><br> <br><br>Water, electricity, indoor plumbing and trash collection are not available.

The wilderness was one of the original areas protected under the 1964 Wilderness Act and has since been expanded twice to its present size of 160,648 acres. The area boasts ecosystems ranging from sagebrush meadows in the lower areas, through pine and spruce/fir forests, to alpine tundra at high elevations.<br/><br/>\n\nElk, deer, moose and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin, and cattle frequently pass by the area as well.",

Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the \"toilet bowl.\" The fish feed on Mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.\n<p>\nThe stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.\n</p><p>\nFor hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This 8-mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area.\n</p><p>\nBoating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible in the area.\n</p><h2>Facilities</h2>\nDearhamer Campground has 13 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs. There is a maximum length of 35 feet for RVs. \n<p>\nThe sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings. Guests also have access to vault toilets and a drinking water hydrant, but electrical hook-ups are not available.\n</p><h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.\n<p>\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n</p>\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there are a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this resort mountain town.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The Greenhorn Mountain Wilderness was designated by Congress in 1993 and it now has a total of 23,087 acres. Soaring dramatically from the plains of Colorado, Greenhorn Mountain rises from 7,600 to 12,347 feet in the center of the northern section. Its summit is the highest point in the Wilderness, and nowhere else in the state provides such a vivid and dramatic change from plains to mountains.</p><p>About two-thirds of the area is forested, and as you hike along, you'll pass quickly from dry oakbrush and ponderosa pine country (or pinion-juniper in some places) through aspen, fir, and spruce, and on to alpine tundra. Most of the east-facing slopes are steep, rocky, and generally bare. Unusual for Colorado, Greenhorn Mountain Wilderness has no lakes and no towering alpine peaks--and, consequently, few human visitors. Numerous small canyons and sharp ridges are the dominant geological features. A few streams descending from the mountain furnish a habitat for threatened greenback cutthroat trout. With relatively little snow, the area attracts bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer.</p><p>Only 11 miles of trail cross the Wilderness, all in the northern half. The southern half, remote and rugged and waterless, probably has fewer human visitors than any other area of the state. If you're willing to brave the dense woodlands and rough topography, you'll find few places with as much solitude.</p><p>Please help keep Wilderness wild by following <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> practices. </p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nWindy Point is located near Dillon Reservoir at an elevation of 9,000 feet in the White River National Forest. The site consists of a group camp and a group picnic \nshelter that can accommodate up to 100 people each.<br/><br/>\n\nWith views to Dillon Reservoir and several mountain ranges, Windy Point is ideal for larger groups seeking recreation and relaxation.\n\nDue to the pine beetle infestation and removal of hazard trees, there is little or no shade at Windy Point.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nDillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to Windy Point and an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing. Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.<br/><br/>\n \nOpportunities for hiking and biking include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.<br/><br/> \n\nFrom the reservoir, the Old Dillon Reservoir Trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir.<br/><br/><h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Windy Point Group Campground has two group campsites available for the use; the Lake Loop and the Forest Loop.  Both loops are able to accommodate tents, trailers and RV's.  Electrical hook-ups are not available.  Each loop is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, and vault toilets and both are pet friendly.  Additionally, the Lake Loop has a handicap-accessible group picnic shelter available for use.  Boat ramp access is available in the marinas located in the nearby towns of Frisco and Dillion.<br><br><br><br></p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nDescribed as being more vertical than horizontal, the nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness, designated in 1976, is a playground of craggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes, and deep, forested valleys. Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.<br/><br/>\n \n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nArapahoe Basin, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mountain ski resorts are all located within 10 miles from Dillon Reservoir. These resorts stay open year round.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Chalk Lake Campground is located in beautiful Chaffee County, Colorado. This popular facility sits near Chalk Lake and is within 4 miles of a private hot springs resort, making it an ideal location for rest and relaxation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"First come, first served\" does not necessarily mean that the site will be available when you get there. Someone may get there before you. This is a popular campground and is normally full starting on Friday, sometimes as early as Thursday, so plan accordingly.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nChalk Lake is located next to the campground and is a great family fishing spot with rainbow, brook and brown trout. Motorized boats are not allowed on the lake. Chalk Creek also offers fishing, and it's best above Cascade Falls. \n  \nPlenty of off-road vehicle trails are near the campground. Recommended rides include Mount Antero, Baldwin Lake, Tincup Pass, Hancock Pass, Pomeroy Lakes, and Hancock Lakes.\n  \nThe Cascade Loop Trail is located across the street from the campground. The Chalk Creek Trailhead  is about 2 miles east of the campground which gives hikers access to the extensive Colorado Trail, which extends nearly 500 miles from Denver to Durango.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers single-family sites, a few of which are accessible. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Accessible vault toilets are provided. Firewood is sold on-site.\n\nSites: #4-9, and 14 \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served sites. All other sites are reservable. \nSite #1 is used by the host from mid-May to mid-September. After that time it is available as a \"walk-up\", first-come, first-served site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 9,000 feet in Chalk Creek Canyon, which gets its name from the soft, white, chalk-like kaolinite canyon walls. Kaolinite is a clay mineral that was deposited by percolating hot springs. A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area, including chipmunks, hummingbirds, birds of prey and mule deer.\n  \n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nTake a day trip to the historic ghost town of St. Elmo, just 15 minutes from the campground. An old saloon, county courthouse and many other historic structures remain from the days of its mining glory. Rock hounds come to the area in search of quartz and aquamarine.\n  \n\n\nThe city of Salida and Town of Buena Vista are only a short drive away where visitors can enjoy distinctive restaurants, unique shops, incredible art galleries and a large selection of antique shops.  The area boasts more than 100 miles of Arkansas River to raft, fish, float or kayak in, as well as fifteen 14,000 ft mountains. Visitors can choose from recreational activities like hiking, biking, ATV/UTV riding, kayaking, rafting, fishing, horseback riding, zipping and swimming.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThe cabin provides visitors with access to many recreation opportunities in the remote back country. The cabin was originally built around 1911 and was home to a forest guard. Early forest guards usually lived in tents, but if they were lucky, in a cabin like the Bassam Guard Station. Forest guards monitored grazing sheep and cattle, managed timber harvesting, apprehended poachers, and reported fire, road and weather conditions.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Visitors may wish to take a day trip to the Arkansas River for kayaking, whitewater rafting or fishing. There are many recreational activities on the Salida Ranger District including hiking, biking, horseback riding, and OHV riding on designated forest roads and trails. <br><br>Or take a trip to the historic ghost town of St. Elmo. An old saloon, county courthouse and many other historic structures remain from the days of its mining glory.<br><br> The City of Salida and Town of Buena Vista offer visitor’s unique restaurants,  shops, and art galleries to enjoy.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 14 x 16 cabin includes a full-sized bed, dresser, a small table with two chairs, a two-burner propane stove for cooking, and a wood-burning stove for heat. A metal campfire ring and picnic table are onsite. The cabin sleeps two adults, and an additional six adults may camp outside in tents or a camper. The bunkhouse and barn are off-limits to the public.\n  \nHorses may be picketed or corralled outside of the fenced area by the entrance of the cabin site. Portable corrals are permitted, but must be moved every few days to prevent damage to vegetation and soil. \n  \nWater is available at a hand pump, but guests are advised to bring extra drinking water. Limited cooking and dining utensils are provided. Guests should also bring food, matches, toilet paper, flashlights, bedding, garbage bags, and an ax for chopping firewood. Dead and downed wood may be collected and used in campfires and in the wood-burning stove.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits in a stand of Aspens at an approximate elevation of 9,700 feet, south of Bassam Ridge. The cabin is within the Salida Ranger District, spanning 440,000 acres of public lands in central Colorado. The Arkansas River valley is known locally as the \"Banana Belt of Colorado\" because of the generally mild temperatures and sunny days. Springtime can be deceptive with sporadic spring snowstorms occurring from March to May. During the summer months, days are warm with cool nights. Afternoon thundershowers are common during July and August. The fall months are are generally dry and sunny with cooler morning temperatures.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located near the eastern boundary of Browns Canyon National Monument. Explore the monument from the Bassam Park area on foot or mountain bike (trail 1435). Or, for those with high clearance vehicles, take a scenic drive along Aspen Ridge Road (road 185). Note that much of the monument's western side is being managed as a wilderness study area, so motorized vehicles and bicycles are not allowed. \n\n\n\n\n",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Salida travel north on Highway 285 to the junction with Highways 24/285 near Johnson's Village. Turn right onto Hwys 24/285, passing through Johnson's Village. Stay on this highway for 5 miles, then watch for a sign on the left for County Road 307 (next to private property with railroad items on display). Turn right onto CR 307 and travel for 1.5 miles to the junction with CR 187. Turn right onto CR 187 and travel south for 7 miles to the intersection with CR 186. Turn left on CR 186 and travel southeast for .10 miles. Watch for a two-track road on the left(186 A). This road will take you to the gated entrance to the cabin. Roads may be slippery  and muddy after rain or snow, drive with caution.\n",

Visitors enjoy the area for its abundant trail opportunities, fishing and beautiful scenery.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nMountain biking and hiking are popular activities in this challenging, rugged terrain. Canoeing and fishing are favorite pastimes as well. The lake is usually so full of fish, one can see them rise to the calm surface. <h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers several single-family campsites, some of which are accessible. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Drinking water is provided.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is set high in the Colorado Rockies at an elevation of 10,200 feet. Summer days are cool and afternoon showers are common. Nights can be chilly. \n<br/><br/>\nLake Irwin borders the campground on the east, and the Ruby Mountain Range lies to the west. Vivid wildflowers fill the landscape during July and August. Most campsites are shaded by mature Englemann spruce and subalpine fir trees.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests are located on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. Together, the three forests cover 2.9 million acres in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, south of the Colorado River and west of the Continental Divide.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe charming town of Crested Butte is a short drive from the campground. The former coal mining town offers a variety of outdoor activities, dining and shopping options and annual festivals, like the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival. ",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSaddlehorn Campground is located within Colorado National Monument which preserves one of the grand landscapes of the American West. Much more than a monument, towering monoliths exist within a vast plateau and canyon panorama. You can experience sheer-walled, red rock canyons along the twists and turns of Rim Rock Drive, where you may spy bighorn sheep and soaring eagles.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nColorado National Monument is famous in cycling communities for its majestic views and challenging climbs, but Historic Rim Rock Drive is also a popular motor tour. Hikers flock to the miles of maintained trails, photographers come year round to capture the spectacular views, and geologists study the unique landscape for its scientific value. Climbers come for the towering sandstone, and wildlife lovers may spot Desert Bighorn sheep, golden eagles, collared lizards, and many other special creatures.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Saddlehorn Campground is located near the Saddlehorn Visitor Center, four miles from the west entrance (near Fruita, Colorado) and nineteen miles from the east entrance (near Grand Junction, Colorado), and is the only established campground within the Monument.  There are 79 campsites with three camping loops within the Saddlehorn Campground (Loop's A, B, and C).  From late-March to mid-October, campsites in Loop A and Loop B (both tents and RVs) can be reserved or taken for one-night only, while Loop C is first come first serve (tents and small vehicles).   Loop A is open year round and is first come first serve from mid-October to late-March (sites suitable for both tents and RVs).  Restrooms have flush toilets and water available during the summer, and each site has a picnic table and charcoal-only grill.  There are no electric hookups or showers.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is nestled within large red rock formations, with pinyon and juniper trees providing adequate shade. There are spectacular views of the Grand Valley to the northwest, and some of the park's most scenic monoliths and canyons to the southeast\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cities of Grand Junction, Fruita, and Palisade boast many urban and agricultural attractions, but there are also abundant recreation areas surrounding the Monument.

Visitors enjoy the area for its great fishing, hiking and scenic driving opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Dolores River is a popular fishing destination that can often be crowded on summer weekends. Anglers will find rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area boasts some excellent trails. The Colorado Trail follows the ridge across Bolam Pass. The Lizard Head and Cross Mountain Trails near Lizard Head Pass lead to alpine basins surrounded by 14,000-foot peaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Barlow Creek Road continues past the campground and crosses Bolam Pass with spectacular views. Road conditions near the pass often limit travel to four-wheel drive vehicles. The route eventually connects with the Hermosa Park Road, behind Durango Mountain Resort, and leads to U.S. Highway 550.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers 27 single-family campsites, many of which are situated along the river. Eighteen sites offer electric hookups. Each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Vault toilets, drinking water and a dump station are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated near the banks of the Dolores River, in a grassy meadow surrounded by fir and aspen trees. At an elevation of 9,400 feet, campers should expect cool evenings.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Priest Gulch Trailhead, 11 miles southwest of Rico, leads to the alpine country west of the campground. The Bear Creek Trail, 14 miles south of Rico, heads southeast into the La Plata Mountains. Other nearby trails include the Calico National Recreation Trail and the Rico-Silverton Trail.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighway 145, which runs between the campground and Telluride, offers some of the most majestic scenery along the San Juan Skyway, including views of the \"<a href=\"http://www.14ers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">14ers</a>,\" which are peaks over 14,000 feet.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation.

The ghost town of Stunner is just east of the campground. This was a mining town that failed due to nonproducing mines and transportation problems. Parts of the town are private property, so pack out all your trash and observe posted trespassing signs.  Stunner Campground is beside the Alamosa River 2 miles below the top of Stunner Pass. There are 10 campsites with tables, fireplaces, vault type toilet, ample parking and a developed water system operated with a hand pump. Firewood is limited. Convenient trailer spaces available. The Alamosa River is nearby for fishing, unfortunately, naturally acidic water severely limits fishing in the Alamosa River between Stunner Campground and Terrace Reservoir. Big game hunting is possible. Stunner is a ghost town of historic significance. Please pack your trash. Obtain permission before entering any private property in the area.  Stunner, never very big, has long been a ghost town with ghost mines on both sides of the Alamosa. The names of its mines have a special flavor -- the Orpheus, Cornucopia, the Merrimac, Log Cabin, and Snow Storm, and as always, a mine named for a wife, daughter or sweetheart, the Louise. Only those mines north of the river shipped payable ore; those south, shipped no ore. Stunner, like the Platoro camp south across the mountain to the left, had transportation problems. The government road had washed out by 1885 and was not repaired because of the discontinuance of the forts at Fort Garland and at Pagosa Springs, and the construction of a railroad over Cumbres Pass to the south. This meant mail was delivered by pack trains and post riders in the summer and on skis in the winter.  The ink-blue, fringed gentians bloom in the meadow in late August. One of the nation's earlier transcontinental telephone lines passed here, built about 1910. The Telephone Cabins sheltered the heroic m",

This family-friendly campground is a popular summer destination for boating, hiking and fishing.<br><br><br><br>The campground was named for Elizabeth McCourt, whose nickname was Baby Doe. She made a name for herself in the Colorado mining community in the 19th century when she took on the rugged work of a miner.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe 1.2-mile Turquoise Lake Nature Trail meanders along the shoreline is a gentle loop trail through the forest and down to the shoreline of Turquoise Lake. This trail connects to the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail that parallels the shoreline from Sugar Loaf Dam to May Queen Campground.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nBrewery Creek Guard Station is situated at an elevation of 9,500 feet in a densely wooded aspen grove overlooking Brewery Creek. The cabin is a few miles south of the Continental Divide on the northern end of the San Luis Valley in the Rio Grande National Forest.\n<br/><br/> \nBuilt in 1935, the two room cabin was originally used by a forest ranger who oversaw the Poncha and Bonanza Districts of what was then called the Cochetopa National Forest.\n<br/><br/>\nToday the cabin is a comfortable getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south central Colorado.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe area offers many opportunities for hiking and off-road vehicle adventures in summer, hunting in the fall, and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter.<br/><br/>\nSeveral hiking trails are in close proximity to the cabin, including several leading up to Antora and Antora Meadows.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin is furnished with three bunkbeds (the top is a single bed, the bottom is a fold-out futon couch that sleeps two) and can accommodate up to nine people.\n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin has stove, refrigerator and heater, all powered with propane. The kitchen is equipped with cooking utensils and some pots and pans.  Picnic tables, a fire pit and a outdoor vault toilet are also on site.\n<br/><br/> \nThe guard station does not have electricity, though water is available from an outside hand pump. Water is also available at the Saguache Ranger District Office during business hours from May through November.<br/><br/>\nAlthough the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. It is recommended that guests bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin offers wonderful views of Antora Peak (13,266 feet) and Windy Point (12,129 feet) towering over the valley. Active beaver dams occupy the nearby creek just below the cabin, where anglers can cast a line into the frigid waters. Elk, deer, and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBrewery Creek Guard Station is located 2 miles from Bonanza, a historical silver mining town that was booming in the 1880's. Today visitors to Bonanza can see old mines, historical buildings, and old time mining equipment as they follow the Bonanza Mines Off-Highway Vehicle Tour. Maps for the Bonanza Off-Highway Vehicle Tour are available at the Saguache Ranger Station.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Saguache, go north on Hwy 285 for 15 miles to Villa Grove. Take the Bonanza turnoff, County Rd LL56, on the left 0.1 mile north of Villa Grove. Stay on LL56 about 13 miles west to the \"Brewery Creek \" sign and make a left turn, crossing a bridge. Travel on Forest Road #880 for 1.5 miles. The gate is located .25 miles before the cabin.\n <br/><br/>\nWinter access may be limited to showshoes, skis or snowmobile. During the spring snow melt, March through mid May, hiking 1.5 miles may be the only option for accessing the cabin. Seasonal road closures may also be in effect, check conditions prior to your arrival.",

On the 14-mile one-way drive, you can stop at Mount Goliath Nature Center, Summit Lake Park and the Summit Interpretive area of Mount Evans.</p>\n\n<p>When you drive up the road and get above tree-line, you will be entering an alpine environment where the Mountain Goats, Marmots, and Bighorn Sheep call this place home year-round. You can also walk amongst the alpine wildflowers as well. It’s a harsh environment, but the plants and wildlife are well adapted to live on Mount Evans.  The different environments on Mount Evans are one of a kind, and we want to keep them sustainable and be able to be visited for years to come. To help protect the purity and uniqueness of the area, we ask that you learn and practice ‘’Leave No Trace’’ ethics.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThe popular Big Creek Lakes Campground offers a peaceful, scenic setting in the heart of the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado. The campground is located in Routt National Forest at an elevation of 9,000-ft., and is adjacent to Big Creek Lake, where fishing, boating and hiking are available.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThis campground offers boating and fishing on Colorado's second largest natural lake, hiking in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness and ATV trails nearby. There are also ample opportunities for viewing wildlife, including moose.\n<br/><br/>\nFishing for trout, muskie, grayling and Kokanee salmon is available in the lake. Anglers also have access to a creek. Non-motorized boats are allowed on the upper section of the lake and motorized boats are permitted on the lower section.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis facility has a campground and day use area. There are 24 reservable campsites and 30 first-come, first-served campsites, all of which are near Big Creek Lake.<br/><br/>\nTwo boat ramps are provided for the convenience of boaters and anglers. A campground host is on-site for visitor assistance.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nBig Creek lies among Lodgepole pine and fir trees. Some previously forested areas of the campground have been thinned due to pests and now provide more sun. The campground offers beautiful views of the surrounding wilderness.\n<br/><br/>\nThe wetlands around the lake are prime moose territory. Black bear, bobcat, coyote, elk, mule deer and moose are just some of the many animals that inhabit these rich and diverse lands.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and Thunder Basin National Grassland, encompass nearly 3 million acres from central and northeastern Wyoming to north-central Colorado.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe closest town is Walden, Colorado, about 35 miles from the campsite. Many more outdoor recreation opportunities exist in the surrounding national forests and grasslands, including hiking, biking, camping, horseback riding, OHV riding, fishing, hunting, sightseeing and winter sports.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>Sangre de Cristo Wilderness was designated by congress in 1993 and it now has a total of 220,803 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Colorado and is managed by the Forest Service and the National Park Service. The Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is bordered by the Great Sand Dunes Wilderness to the west.</p><p>Sangre de Cristo is Spanish for \"Blood of Christ,\" but no one is quite sure why the region was given this name. Was it because of the bloody hues washing the slopes at sunset, or the cry of the dying priest, \"sangre de Cristo,\" as his martyred blood flowed onto the ground near here? Of the long and colorful Spanish influence in these mountains and in the San Luis Valley below there is no doubt. Two four-wheel-drive roads over Medano Pass and Hayden Pass, as well as access to Lily Lake, were slim exclusions from Wilderness designation and split the area into four distinct sections.</p><p>Unlike most of Colorado's mountains, the high and magnificently rugged Sangres were uplifted suddenly in massive blocks, creating a range of dramatic vertical proportions. Four fourteeners are clumped together in the midsection of the Wilderness, including Crestone Needle (14,197 feet). Many climbers, consider the Needle to be Colorado's most challenging 14,000-foot peak. Three more fourteeners stand together just south of the boundary. Melting snow feeds many creeks and small lakes, and nourishes a forest of oak, aspen, and spruce. Black bears and a few mountain lions live here, along with elk, deer, and bighorn sheep.</p><p>Long (about 70 miles) and narrow describes the area, the state's third largest, and the going is rough for the hiker. Most of the 180 miles of trails end at alpine lakes set against virtually unclimbable walls. Great Sand Dunes National Preserve in now part of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness.</p><p>Please help keep Wilderness wild by following <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leave No Trace</a> practices. </p>",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSilver Bar Campground is located approximately five miles southwest of Aspen, Colorado, on the banks of Maroon Creek. The campground is adjacent to the Maroon Bells Welcome Station. This small, primitive, campground features four tent-only, walk-in sites with centralized vault toilets only a few yards away from each campsite. A single accessible campsite is located near the toilets and water source. <br/><br/> \n\nThe campground sits at an elevation of 8,460 feet, allowing guests to experience warm summer days and cool evenings with probable afternoon thunderstorms. Properly licensed anglers may fish in Maroon Creek, which runs along the eastern edge of the campground. Come prepared for changing weather conditions. Snow is possible even at the peak of summer.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFor hikers and backpackers, the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Deadly Bells Trailhead at Maroon Lake, the West Maroon Trail gains elevation through aspen groves and evergreens, traverses boulder fields, crosses streams, and leads hikers through high-elevation (10,000+ feet) mountain passes. Climbing through alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in mid-summer. Check specific regulations for camping in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area.<br/><br/>\n\n\nFor day hikers and horseback riders, nearby Maroon Creek Trail offers a less crowded alternative to viewing the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak and the entire Maroon valley. The gentle, flat terrain offers scenic stops that are great for picnicking.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Silver Bar Campground has four walk-in, tent-only sites. RVs and trailers are welcome at the standard sites. Sites are equipped with picnic tables, vault toilets, food storage lockers (bear boxes) and campfire rings. Drinking water and electrical hook-ups are not available.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Maroon Bells Scenic Area is surrounded by the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This wilderness is one of the five original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline. <br/><br/> \n\nTowering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique in the Rockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that gives the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby mountain resort town of Aspen is a popular destination for visitors to the area. From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and resorts, there is a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunities in this mountain town.",

The road does continue past the Capitol Lake Trailhead and climbs very steeply to the Hell Roaring Trailhead. The road is slick when wet.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nBlack Bear Cabin at Mesa Lakes offers guests the opportunity to experience an overnight stay in a traditional Forest Service Ranger Station. The original Black Bear Cabin was constructed in the 1930s, where rangers worked for years overseeing the expansive forest. \n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin is about a 45-minute drive from Grand Junction area of western Colorado, and plenty of canoeing, mountain biking and fishing activities are within reach. From mid-August through October, guests can enjoy fall colors with extensive golden aspen stands surrounding the area. A large grass yard fronts the cabin, which can be used for family gatherings and weddings.\n\nThis cabin is not ADA accessible.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nA popular mountain biking and horseback riding trail, West Bench Trail #501, connects the seven lakes of the Mesa Lakes Recreation Area. The cabin is also within walking distance to a carry-down boat ramp for canoeing and kayaking.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Grand Mesa Scenic Byway is well worth exploring. The byway passes near the cabin and offers 63 miles of scenery as it climbs from the rugged canyon floor up to the forested mesa tops at 11,000 feet. The road passes sparkling lakes and meadows bursting with wildflowers. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe semi-rustic log cabin has a living area and bedroom on the main floor, and a bathroom with a flush toilet and shower is in the basement. The kitchen is equipped with a refrigerator and an electric stove. Electric lighting and heat are provided. \n<br/><br/>\nSleeping accommodations for five adults include queen size sofa sleeper and three twin size beds; air mattresses or cots can be brought in to accommodate three additional people for a total of eight guests. No RVs, campers, or tents allowed near facility to accommodate more people. Basic cooking and eating utensils, plates, knives, forks, spoons, cups, and basic pots and pans are furnished. Cleaning supplies are included as well.\n<br/><br/>\nGuests should bring bedding, warm clothes, food, a first aid kit, towels, dish soap and typical camping gear. <a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8shd123VAQAzHJMsQ!!/?ss=110204&ttype=recarea&recid=41646&actid=24&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&navid=110410000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&cid=null&pname=Grand+Mesa+-+Black+Bear+Cabin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nBlack Bear is perched on a grassy lawn, partially shaded by large pines. Spruce, fir and aspen are among the surrounding trees. At an elevation of 9,500, the cabin is in close proximity to several mountain lakes, including Waterdog Reservoir and Jumbo Reservoir. Mesa Creek flows nearby. \n<br/><br/>\nA variety of wildlife, including deer, elk and moose, frequents the area.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nGrand Mesa Visitor Center is a short drive away at Island Lake. The center offers educational exhibits, a bookstore and a high-altitude wildflower garden containing over 50 native species. \n<br/><br/>\nThe town of Cedaredge, 26 miles from the campground, is home to Pioneer Town, a 19th-century village with frontier museums and over 20 structures housing a schoolhouse, blacksmith shop, saloon and jail. Cedaredge's Applefest is held annually in October.",
          "FacilityDirections": "From Grand Junction, CO, take I-70 east for 13 miles. Take exit 49 to Highway 65 South toward Grand Mesa. Continue for 25 miles and turn right into Mesa Lakes Recreation Area. Take the second right and follow along Sunset Lake shore. On approach to the lake's spillway, you will come to a gate. The gate is opened by combination lock. Open gate and follow through on a single lane road about 100 yards. Cabin is sign posted and parking is in front of the cabin. \n",

Permanent springs at the bottom of the canyon support a variety of wildlife, which can best be seen early in the morning or just before sunset. Vogel Canyon has a rich history. American Indians lived in the canyon 300-800 years ago and left rock art which is visible on the canyon walls.</p><p>During the 1870's, a spur off the Santa National Historic Fe Trail (between Las Animas and Trinidad) was developed by the Barlow and Sanderson Mail and Stage Line. Sections of the stage coach road and ruins of the station can still be found.

Rock art, stone tools, charred bones, and rubble from dwellings provide evidence that people thrived on the Comanche National Grassland for thousands of years. Each relic of the past holds a clue that archaeologists use to reconstruct life here long ago. These cultural resources are ancient, fragile, and irreplaceable. If destroyed or removed, the information they reveal is lost forever. And so is a legacy that belongs to us all.</p><p><strong>Please do not touch rock art!</strong> Oils from your hands promote deterioration of the drawings and the rock surface. <strong>Do not draw or scratch graffiti on rocks or cliff faces</strong>.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPickle Gulch is a group picnic and camping facility located just off the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway/Highway 119. Visitors enjoy the area for its scenic and off-road driving, and nearby hiking and fishing opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nMany hiking and biking trails are found nearby. Scenic driving is available along Highways 119 and 72, which is also known as the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway. Numerous creeks, rivers and lakes in the area provide fishing opportunities. Off-road enthusiasts will find many jeep roads in the vicinity.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nPickle Gulch is an area that offers day-use picnic sites and six campsites to accommodate large groups. The picnic site can accommodate up to 150 people and is equipped with picnic tables and campfire circles. A parking area, vault toilets and a playground are provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group campsites are all walk-to sites for tent camping only. The on-site host has wheelbarrows available for campers, to haul equipment from the parking area. Each campsite is equipped with picnic tables, a campfire circle and tent pads. Vault toilets and drinking water spigots are shared between sites. <br/>\n<br/>\nA separate day-use area contains two volleyball courts, horseshoe pits, picnic tables and a vault toilet. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirewood may be gathered from the surrounding forest, if available, or purchased from the host.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe site offers many scenic views of the surrounding area. It is set among a fairly level forest of lodgepole pine trees, dotted with aspens.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the mountain pine beetle infestation and removal of hazardous trees, there may be little to no shade at these sites.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe historic mining town of Central City is nearby. The town hosts various popular events, including Lou Bunch Day and the Central City Opera and Jazz festivals.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolden Gate Canyon State Park is a short drive from the campground. This scenic park offers more than 35 miles of hiking trails. Mountain biking and horseback riding are also allowed on some trails. Every stream and pond within the park is open to fishing.",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview:</h2><p>Chimney Rock lies within the San Juan National Forest, between Durango and Pagosa Springs in southwestern Colorado. The Monument encompasses 4,726 acres, preserving hundreds of prehistoric sites that dot the landscape around the twin spires known as Chimney Rock and Companion Rock.\n</p><p>Home to the ancestors of the modern Pueblo Indians, the site represents spiritual significance to many tribes; the Ancestral Puebloans built more than 200 homes and ceremonial buildings high above the valley floor, probably to be near the twin rock pinnacles. Some ancient structures have been excavated and stabilized for viewing including: Great Kiva, Pit House, Multi-Family Dwelling, and a Chacoan style Great House Pueblo. Many unexcavated structures stimulate the imagination.\n</p><p>The northeastern-most Chacoan outlier is one of the highest elevation Ancestral Puebloan sites. The mountain peaks to the north and east made it an ideal spot for tracking the movement of the sun and moon. The people of Chimney Rock may have used signal towers at various locations to transmit calendric information to Chaco Canyon.\n</p><p>The Chimney Rock Interpretive Association (CRIA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and conducts daily tours and operates the Visitor Center during the season from May 15 through September 30. Their mission, in partnership with the San Juan National Forest, is to provide the site's care, protection, and preservation, as well as public interpretation and education, and manage the interpretive program at the Monument under a partnership agreement with the Pagosa Ranger District, USDA Forest Service. CRIA offers both self-guided and guided tours seven days a week. The Visitor Center is open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily with the exception of special events.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Summary of Fees</b>\n<br/><br/>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th align=\"center\"><b>Tour  Name </b></th>\n    <th align=\"center\"><b>Adult</b></th>\n<th align=\"center\"><b>Child(5-12)</b></th>\n \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Guided Walking Tours </td>\n    <td>$14.00</td>\n    <td>$7.00</td>\n\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n<td>Night Sky: Stars and Galaxies  </td>\n    <td>$12.00</td>\n    <td>$5.00</td>\n\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full Moon</td>\n    <td>$15.00</td>\n    <td>N/A</td>\n \n  </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Early Tour & Full Moon Package</td>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Night Sky: Our solar System</td>\n<td>$12.00</td>\n<td>$5.00</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Summer Sunrise</td>\n<td>$15.00</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dances of the Ancients</td>\n<td>$15.00</td>\n<td>$5.00</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Geology Tour</td>\n<td>$15.00</td>\n<td>$5.00</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Audio Kiva Trail Tour</td>\n<td>$10.00</td>\n<td>$5.00</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Life at Chimney Rock</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Stories at Sunset</td>\n<td>$15.00</td>\n<td>$5.00</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Early Tour & Stories at Sunset Package</td>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td>$7.50</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br/> <br/>\nPlus a reservation fee of $3.55 per ticket <br/>",

Over 200 species can be found in the area. This oasis on the prairie has cottonwoods which provide some shade and small meadows, and is surrounded by northeastern Colorado's short-grass prairie. There are ample opportunities for sports and recreation for the whole family.</p><p>Crow Valley sits at an elevation of 4,800 feet. Cottonwood and elm trees dot the landscape, providing pleasant shade in the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recreation/recarea/?recid=32174\" rel=\"nofollow\">family campground</a>. However, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recreation/recarea/?recid=32175\" rel=\"nofollow\">group campsites </a>have little to no shade. Short grass prairie surrounds the recreation area. The Pawnee National Grassland sits east of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Eroding creek drainages crisscross the area. Elevations range from 4,900 feet on the prairie to 9,500 feet at the summit of the Pawnee Buttes.</p><p>Birding, exploring nature trails, viewing wildlife and star gazing are popular activities at Crow Valley. A volleyball court, horseshoe pit and ball field are available. The <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recreation/recarea/?recid=32183\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lee and Dorothy Rhoads Farm Implement Museum</a> is located within the recreation area.

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview:</h2><p>Welcome to the river permit lottery application site for Dinosaur National Monument-home to the Green and Yampa Rivers, two of the west's premier whitewater rivers. </p> \n<b><p>Green River: Gates of Lodore</p></b>\n<p>The Green River flows south out of Browns Park into Dinosaur National Monument and cuts through the Uinta Mountains, the largest east-west extending mountain range in the lower 48 states. Within the monument and along this stretch of the Green River lies the imposing Canyon of Lodore, which received its name from John Wesley Powell's expedition in 1869. Three of the rapids so impressed Powell that he named them Disaster Falls, Triplet Falls and Hell's Half Mile. </p> \n<p>The 19-mile run down the Green River from the Gates of Lodore to Echo Park is different today than in Powell's time, largely because of the dam at Flaming Gorge which regulates the flow. This allows for a longer rafting season, but one that is not much affected by spring run-off. However, there are many named and unnamed rapids, well-spaced as in most pool-drop rivers and plenty of beautiful river side campsites and hikes, dominated by the almost 2,000 feet high red cliffs.</p>\n\n<b><p>Yampa River</p></b>\n<p>The Yampa River begins at Deerlodge Park and rushes downstream 44-miles to join the Green River at Echo Park. Boaters continue downstream on the Green River to the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp. The Yampa is the largest free-flowing tributary within the Colorado River system. As such, it has a shorter season marked by fluctuations in water level resulting from snow received in the winter. It is characterized by such famous rapids as Teepee, Big Joe and Warm Springs. </p>\n<b><p>Below the Confluence of the Yampa and the Green River</p></b>\n<p>All trips continue downstream on the Green River from Echo Park through the 17-miles that is Whirlpool Canyon. It was named by Powell because of the squirrelly and unpredictable water the explorers experienced here. </p>\n<p>The last section of the Green River is the nine miles of Split Mountain Canyon beginning at the Rainbow Park boat ramp flowing swiftly downstream, punctuated by four named rapids and assorted riffles before reaching the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp. </p> \n<p>The river corridors within Dinosaur National Monument, with the exception of Echo Park, are proposed wilderness and consequently managed as such. This means you will not hear or see motors or vehicles anywhere along your trip with the possible exception of Echo Park where a dirt road comes down to the water's edge.</p>\n \n<p>Camping facilities exist at the Lodore and Deerlodge launch sites.  Each has campsites, water available seasonally, an information station, staffed ranger station and vault toilets. These remote sites do not provide trash receptacles because of issues with bears.</p>\n<p>The launch locations have been kept fairly primitive to help the visitor transition to the wilderness environment of the canyon.  Due to the remoteness of the area and long drive times, many groups camp at their launch site the night before their river launch.  \n</p><p>At the Split Mountain take-out, there are <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/camping/Split_Mountain_Group_Campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=110134&topTabIndex=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">reservable group campsites</a> (flush toilets seasonally, no showers) as well as vault toilets year-round and a seasonally operational groover dump site. Nearby is the world famous dinosaur quarry where you can see 149 million year old dinosaur bones encased in the rock. </p><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/nrso/co/dnmm/DNMM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Dinosaur National Monument: Green and Yampa Rivers Map</b></a>",

The entire length of this hike; in at Henderson Park trailhead, up to Josephine Lake, out at Henderson Park trailhead; is 10.8 miles from start to finish - a tough one day, yet a beautiful backpack trip. There are great views of the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness to the south with the Elk Mountains off to the right and in the distance. You can also access this trail from Last Chance Creek trail. Wildflowers are in abundance in the meadow on the trails leading to Josephine Lake.</p>",

Turn left at road #501, travel one mile past Elk Wallow Campground and take the left fork one tenth of a mile to the trailhead on the left side of the roadway (difficult to see). It is marked as Henderson Park. The hike up the trail is strenuous at first but mellows out to the first meadow which is Henderson Park. Take the left fork for another mile to Coffeepot Park.

          "FacilityDescription": "<p>The United States Congress designated the Spanish Peaks Wilderness  in 2000 and it now has a total of 19,226 acres. Los Cumbres Espanolos, the Spanish Peaks, are prominent landmarks along the eastern front of the southern Rockies. Their snow-capped summits, rising 7000 feet above the arid plains, made the \"Double Mountain\" an easily recognizable reference point to travelers of all cultures.</p><p>The Peaks have traditional and religious significance to American Indian tribes including the Comanche and Ute. Summer thunderstorms, which often form near the summits, were evidence the rain gods worked their magic on the peaks. The common Indian name appears in at least three different spellings in various accounts, reflecting different renditions of oral expression. These are \"Wahatoya\", Huajatolla\" or Guajatoyah\", roughly interpreted as \"breasts of the earth\". West Spanish Peak with an elevation of 13,623 feet, overtops the East Peak which only has an elevation of 12,708 feet. However, this difference is not readily discernible from a distance.</p><p>The Spanish Peaks are geologically distinct from the faulted and uplifted mountains of the Sangre de Cristo range to the west. To the geologist the Spanish Peaks are prime examples of \"stocks\" which are defined as large masses of igneous (molten) rock which intruded layers of sedimentary rock and were later exposed by erosion. When mapped by geologists the Peaks were found to be masses of granite, granodiorite and syenodiorite.

There is also an additional camping loop geared toward more dispersed camping for equestrian users (a rustic and un-maintained non-motorized trail leads downriver from here for about 8 miles, with several river crossings). The day use area has three picnic tables and shade trees. There is an $8/night camping fee on a first come first served basis. The busiest time of year is when there is a 'boatable release' on the lower Dolores from McPhee Reservoir, generally mid-April to mid-June.

Many mountain streams and creeks nearby offer good fishing opportunities. South Fork is the only facility in the area designated for horse camping.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe South Fork Trail begins at the campground and is one of the most popular trails in the valley. The 26-mile loop trail is open to hiking and horseback riding, and provides access to other trails in the area, including Ptarmigan Pass, Ute Peak and Jones Pass Trails. Mountain biking opportunities also exist in the valley. The Byers Peak Wilderness can be accessed nearby. \n<br/><br/>\nAnglers enjoy trout fishing on the South Fork Creek and numerous additional streams and creeks in the surrounding area. Wildlife viewing opportunities abound.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers one reservable, accessible group site that can accommodate up to 25 people. Individual sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Picnic tables, campfire rings and tents pads are provided, as are flush and pit toilets and drinking water. A small corral, for one or two horses, is located in the campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is located in the Williams Fork Valley next to South Fork Creek at an elevation of 8,962 feet. A cool mountain climate with frequent afternoon thunderstorms should be expected. \n<br/><br/>\nDue to the pine beetle infestation and hazardous tree removal, shade has been reduced throughout the campground.  \n<br/><br/>\nThe Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland sit on the foothills and peaks of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The forests and grassland cover 1.5 million acres and extend north to the Wyoming border, south to Mount Evans and west across the Continental Divide.",

Camp Hale is historic because the 10th Mountain Division, an unit of 15,000 men, trained here in mountaineering and skiing techniques during WWII. Some saw combat in Italy during the war.<br/><br/> \n\nMost of the buildings have been torn down, but foundations and other \"footprints\" remain.<br/><br/>  \n\nThe 99th Infantry Battalion (Viking Battalion) also trained at Camp Hale. There are interpretive signs along US Rt. 24, explaining the history and accomplishments of Camp Hale.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nWith the headwaters of the Eagle River nearby, anglers will find pockets of solitude, casting lines for rainbow and brown \n\ntrout. The waterway was named by the local Ute Indians who thought there were as many branches of the river as there were tail \n\nfeathers on an eagle.<br/><br/> \n\nSeveral ponds south of the campground offer good fishing opportunities.<br/><br/>\n \nThe Colorado Trail crosses within walking distance of Camp Hale, and gravel roads provide easy walking and bike paths within \n\nthe area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nCamp Hale Memorial Campground has 15 standard sites able to accommodate tents, trailers and RVs.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, and vault toilets. Drinking water and electrical hook-\n\nups are not available at this site.  Visitors must provide their own water.<br/><br/>\n\nThe road, parking area and spurs in the campground are gravel.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. \nAlpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse \nforests to live.<br/><br/>\n\nThis campground sits among a sparse growth of young Lodgepole pine in a wide, flat, open valley.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe resort town of Vail is a popular destination for visitors to the area, offering downhill skiing, world-class fly fishing, dining and resorts. There is a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunites in this mountain town.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

          "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAt an elevation of 9,320 feet, Lowry Campground is located between Summit Cove and Breckenridge, Colorado in the White River National Forest.<br/><br/> \n\nThis campground is in close proximity to Dillon Reservoir and a handful of trails, making it an ideal setting for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.\n<br/><br/> \n\nDue to the pine beetle infestation and removal of hazard trees, there is little or no shade in the campground.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nDillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground, offering 26.8 miles of shoreline. It is an ideal spot for \n\nfishing, boating, and sailing. Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, \n\nwith an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.<br/><br/>\n \nOpportunities for hiking and biking include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail \n\nsystem.<br/><br/> \n\nFrom the reservoir, the Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile \n\nRange and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of \n\nDillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nLowry Campground has 27 sites able to accommodate tents, trailers, and RVs. Three tent-only campsites are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.<br/><br/>\n\nSites 2-24 have electric hookups. There is an extra fee for the electrical service at these sites.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, drinking water and vault toilets. <br/><br/> \n\nAll campsites are allowed 10 people and two vehicles only, with a maximum vehicle length of 32 feet.<br/><br/>\n\nFirewood is for sale from hosts at the campground. Boat ramp access is available in the marinas located in the nearby towns of Frisco and Dillon.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4 \ndefined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.<br/><br/>\n\nDescribed as being more vertical than horizontal, the nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness, designated in 1976, is a playground of \n\ncraggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes, and deep, forested valleys. Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine \n\narea challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.<br/><br/> \n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations \n\nof cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many \n\nothers, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nArapahoe Basin, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mountain ski resorts are all located within 10 miles from Dillon Reservoir. These \nresorts stay open year round.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",
